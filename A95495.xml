            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am againſt my Reſolution and proper diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the over-ruling power of the divine providence which wiſely diſpoſes all things, accidentally engaged in the Queſtion of Tranſubſtantiation, which hath already ſo many times paſſed by the Fire and <hi>under the Saw</hi> of Contention: that it might ſeem, nothing could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main which had not been already conſidered, and ſifted to the bran. I had been by chance ingaged in a conference with a perſon of another perſwaſion, the man not unlearned nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary, but much more confident then I perceived the ſtrength of his argument could warrant; and yet he had ſome few of the beſt which their Schools did furniſh out and ordinarily miniſter to their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, their <hi>Emiſſaries</hi> and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of temptation to our people. I then began to conſider whether there we not much more in the ſecret of the Queſtion which might not have perſwaded <hi>him</hi> more fiercely then I could then ſee cauſe for, <hi>or others</hi> at leaſt, from whom upon the ſtrength of education he might have derived his confidence; and ſearching into all the ſecrets of it, I found infinite reaſon to reprove the boldneſſe of thoſe men, who in the ſum of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
<pb facs="tcp:113292:3"/>and upon examination will be found to think men damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if they will not ſpeak non-ſenſe, and disbelieve their eyes and ears, and defie their own reaſon, and recede from anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and believe them in whatſoever they dream, or liſt to obtrude upon the world who hath been too long credulous, or it could never have ſuffered ſuch a propoſition to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by ſo many men againſt all the demonſtration in the world. And certainly, it is no ſmall matter of wonder, that thoſe men of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſhould pretend learning, and yet reſt their new articles of faith upon propoſitions againſt all learning; that they ſhould ingage their ſcholars to read and believe <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and yet deſtroy his philoſophy, and reaſon by their article; that they ſhould think all the world fools but themſelves, and yet talk and preach ſuch things which if men had ſpoken before this new device aroſe, they would have been thought mad. But if theſe men had by chance or intereſt fallen upon the other opinion which we maintain againſt them, they would have filled the world with declamations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the impoſſible propoſitions and the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of their adverſaries; They would have called us <hi>dunces, idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots,</hi> men without ſouls, without philoſophy, without Senſe, without Reaſon, without Logick, deſtroyers of the very firſt notions of mankind. But now that they are ingaged upon the impoſſible ſide, they proceed with a prodigious boldneſſe, and ſeem to wonder that mankind does not receive from them all their firſt principles and credit the wildneſſe and new notions of their <hi>Cataphyſicks</hi> (for <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> it is not) their affirmatives and negatives are neither <hi>natural,</hi> nor <hi>above,</hi> nor <hi>beſides</hi> nature, but againſt it in thoſe firſt principles which are primely credible. For that I may uſe S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> words: <hi>Nemo enim huic evidentiae contradicet, niſi quem plus defenſare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectat quod ſentit, quàm quid ſentiendum ſit invenìre.</hi> But I ſee it is poſſible for a man to believe any thing that he hath a mind to; and this to me ſeems to have been permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the vanity of mans imagination, and the confidence of
<pb facs="tcp:113292:3"/>opinion, to make us humble, apt to learn, inquiſitive, and charitable: for if it be poſſible for ſo great a company of men of all ſorts and capacities to believe ſuch impoſſible things and to wonder that others do not <hi>eandem inſaniam inſanire,</hi> it will concern the wiſeſt man alive, to be inquiſitive in the articles of his fierce perſwaſion, to be diligent in his ſearch, modeſt in his ſentences, to prejudge no man, to reprove the adverſaries with meekneſſe, and a ſpirit conſcious of humane weakneſſe and aptneſſe to be abuſed. But if we remember that <hi>Pere Coton</hi> Confeſſor to <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. of <hi>France</hi> was wont to ſay, that <hi>he could do any thing when he had his God in his hand and his King at his feet,</hi> meaning <hi>him</hi> at confeſſion, and the <hi>other</hi> in <hi>effigie</hi> of the <hi>Crucifix</hi> or in the <hi>Hoſt,</hi> we may well perceive that they are not ſuch fools but they will conſider the advantages that come to their perſons and calling, if they can be ſuppoſed to make, with pronouncing four words, bread to become God. Upon the reputation of this great thing the Prieſts were exempt from from ſecular <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, in the Councel in <hi>Dalmatia</hi> held by the <hi>Legats</hi> of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third <hi>A. D.</hi> 1199. <hi>Can.</hi> 5. upon this account Pope <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the ſecond in a Councel which he held at <hi>Rome</hi> (1097) againſt the <hi>Emperour Henry</hi> the fourth, took from ſecular Princes the inveſtiture of Benefices, and advanced the Clergy above Kings, becauſe <hi>their hands create God their Creatour,</hi> as <hi>Simeon Dunelmenſis</hi> reports <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Chron. apud Vigner. Hiſt. Eccleſ.</hi> And the ſame horrible words are uſed in the famous book called <hi>Stella Clericorum:</hi> where the Prieſt is called <hi>the creator of his Creator;</hi> and thence alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers his privilege and immunity from being condemned. I will not with any envy and reproach object to them that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a <hi>Bohemian Prieſt</hi> againſt which <hi>John Hus</hi> wrote a book on purpoſe, that <hi>before the Prieſt ſaid his firſt Maſs, he was but the ſon of God, but afterward he was the Father of God, and the Creator of his body;</hi> It was a rude kind of <hi>blaſphemy,</hi> but not much more then that which their ſevereſt
<pb facs="tcp:113292:4"/>men do ſay, and were never corrected by their <hi>expurgatory indices,</hi> and is to be ſeen in <hi>Biel</hi> on Canon of the Maſſe, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> 4. and <hi>Pere dè Beſſè</hi> in his <hi>Royal Prieſthood;</hi> l. 1. c. 3. where the Prieſt upon the ſtock of his power is advanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Angels, and the bleſſed Virgin her ſelf; which is the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt expreſſion which they can deviſe, unleſſe they advance him above God himſelf. The conſequent of this is <hi>a double honour,</hi> that is, an <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>maintenance</hi> in ſuch a manner as may ſerve the deſigne of ambition, and fill the belly of covetouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>This was enough to make them willing to introduce it, and (as to them) the wonder ceaſes, but it is ſtrange the world could receive it; For though men might be willing to believe a thing that would make for their profit and reputation, yet that they ſhould entertain it to their prejudice, as the other part muſt do, that at ſo great a price, and with ſo great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of their rights, they ſhould ſuffer themſelves to be couſen'd of their reaſon, is the ſtranger thing of the two. But to this alſo, there were many concurrent cauſes; For, 1. This doctrine entred upon the world in the moſt barbarous, moſt ignorant, and moſt vitious ages of the world; for we know when it began, by what ſteps and progreſſions it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd, and by what inſtruments. It began in the ninth age, and in the <hi>tenth</hi> was ſuckled with little arguments and imperfect pleadings, in the <hi>eleventh</hi> it grew up with illuſions and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of miracles, and was chriſtened and confirmed in the <hi>twelfth,</hi> and afterwards lived upon bloud, and craft, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; But when it was diſputed by <hi>Paſchaſius Ratbert</hi> the Deacon in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Century, the firſt collateral device by which they attempted to ſet up their fancy was to deviſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, which we find done accordingly in the ſame <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> telling a tale of <hi>Plegilus</hi> ſeeing upon the altar a babe like that which was pictured in the arms of <hi>Simeon:</hi> in <hi>Joannes Diaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> telling a ſtory of ſomething in the dayes of S. <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, but never told by any before him, <hi>viz.</hi> in the year
<pb facs="tcp:113292:4"/>873, that is 270 years after the death of S. <hi>Gregory;</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the <hi>Archives</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Italy</hi> out of <hi>England,</hi> where it ſeems they could better tell what ſo long before done at <hi>Rome,</hi> by <hi>Damianus</hi> in the year 1060 who tells two more; by <hi>Guitmond</hi> writing againſt <hi>Berengarius</hi> out of the <hi>Vitae P P.</hi> by <hi>Lanfranck,</hi> who ſerved his end upon the report of ſtrange apparitions, and from him <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Hales</hi> alſo tells a pretty tale. For they then obſerved that the common people did not only then believe all reports of miracles, but deſired them paſſionately, and with them would ſwallow any thing; But how vainly and falſly the world was then abuſed, we need no greater witneſſe then the learned biſhop of the <hi>Canaries, Melchier Canus.</hi> And yet even one of theſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, though poſſible apt enough to credit or report any ſuch fine device, for the promotion of his new opinion, yet it is vehemently ſuſpected, that even the tale which was reported out of <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> was a long time after his death thruſt in by ſome Monk in a place to which it relates not, and which without that tale would be more united and more coherent: and yet if this and the other miracles pretended, had not been illuſions or directly fabulous, it had made very much againſt the preſent doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, for they repreſent the body in ſuch manner as by their explications it is not, and it cannot be: they repreſent it broken, a finger or a piece of fleſh or bloudy or bleeding, or in the form of an infant; and then when it is in the ſpecies of bread; for if as they ſay Chriſts body is preſent no longer then the form of bread re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, how can it be Chriſts body in the miracle, when the ſpecies being gone it is no longer a Sacrament? But the dull inventors of miracles in thoſe ages, conſidered nothing of this; the article it ſelf was then groſſe and rude, and ſo were the inſtruments of probation. I noted this, not only to ſhew at what door ſo incredible a perſwaſion entred, but that the zeal of prevailing in it hath ſo blinded the <hi>refiners</hi> of it in this age, that they ſtill urge theſe miracles for proof, when if
<pb facs="tcp:113292:5"/>they do any thing at all, they reprove the preſent doctrine.</p>

And now the wonder is out, it is not ſtrange that the article hath been ſo readily entertained. But in the Greek Churches it could not prevaile, as appears not onely in <hi>Cyrils</hi> book of late, dogmatically affirming the article in our ſenſe, but in the anſwer of Cardinal <hi>Humbert</hi> to <hi>Nicetas</hi> who maintained the receiving the holy Sacrament does break the faſt, which it could not do if it were not, when it ſeems, bread and wine, as well as what we believe it to be, the body and bloud of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And now in proſecution of their ſtrange improbable ſucceſs
<pb facs="tcp:113292:5"/>they proceed to perſwade all People that they are fools, and do not know the meaſures of ſenſe, nor underſtand the words of Scripture, nor can tell when any of the Fathers ſpeak af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively or negatively; and after many attempts made by diverſe unproſperouſly enough (as the thing did conſtrain and urge them) a great wit Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> hath undertaken the Qu. and hath ſpun his thread ſo fine and twiſted it ſo intricate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and adorned it ſo ſprucely with language and ſophiſmes, that although he connot reſiſt the evidence of truth, yet he is too ſubtle for moſt mens diſcerning; and though he hath been conteſted by potent adverſaries, and wiſe men, in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cauſe then his own, yet he will alwayes make his reader believe that he prevails; which puts me in mind of what <hi>Thucydides</hi> told <hi>Archidamus</hi> the King of <hi>Sparta</hi> as king him whether he or <hi>Pericles</hi> were the better wraſtler? he told him that when he threw <hi>Pericles</hi> on his back he would with fine words perſwade the people that he was not down at all, and ſo he got the better. So does he; and is to all conſidering men a great argument of the danger that articles of religion are in, and conſequently mens perſwaſions, and final intereſt, when they fall into the hands of a witty man and a ſophiſter, and one who is reſolved to prevail by all means. But truth is ſtronger then wit, and can endure when the other cannot, and I hope, it will appear ſo in this Qu. which although it is managed by weak hands, that is, by mine, yet to all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial perſons it muſt be certain and prevailing upon the ſtock of his own ſincerity and derivation from God.</p>
            <p>And now (R. R.) though this Qu. hath ſo often been diſputed and ſome things ſo often ſaid, yet I was willing to bring it once more upon the ſtage, hoping to add ſome clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to it, and by fitting it with a good inſtrument, and clear conveyance, and repreſentment, by ſaying ſomething new, and very many which are not generally known, and leſſe generally noted; and I thought there was a preſent neceſſity of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Emiſſaries</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are buſie now
<pb facs="tcp:113292:6"/>to diſturb the peace of conſciences by troubling the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and injecting ſcruples into the infortunate, who ſuſpect every thing, and being weary of all, are moſt ready to change from the preſent. They have got a trick to ask, where is our Church now! what is become of your articles, of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? We cannot anſwer them as they can be anſwered; for nothing ſatisfies them, but being proſperous, and that we cannot pretend to, but upon the accounts of the Croſſe, and ſo we may indeed <hi>rejoyce and be exceeding glad,</hi> becauſe we hope that <hi>great is our reward in heaven.</hi> But although they are pleaſed to uſe an argument that like <hi>Jonas Gourd</hi> or <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragus</hi> is in ſeaſon only at ſome times, yet we according to the nature of truth, inquire after the truth of their religion upon the account of proper and theological objections; Our Church may be a beloved Church and dear to God though ſhe be perſecuted when theirs is in an evil condition by obtruding upon the Chriſtian world articles of religion againſt all that which ought to be the inſtruments of credibility and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by diſtorting and abuſing the Sacraments, by making er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to be an art, and that a man muſt be witty to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf capable of being abuſed, by out-facing all ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by damning their brethren for not making their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſervile and ſottiſh, by burning them they can get, and curſing them that they cannot get, by doing ſo much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence to their own reaſons, and forcing themſelves to believe that no man ever ſpake againſt their new device, by making a prodigious error to be neceſſary to ſalvation, as if they were Lords of the Faith of Chriſtendome.</p>
            <p>But theſe men are grown to that ſtrange triumphal gayety upon their joy that the Church of <hi>England</hi> as they think is deſtroyed, that they tread upon her grave which themſelves have digged for her who lives and pities them; and they wonder that any man ſhould ſpeak in her behalf, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe men doe it out of ſpight and indignation, and call the duty of her ſons who are by perſecution made more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb facs="tcp:113292:6"/>pious, and zealous in defending thoſe truths for which ſhe ſuffers on all hands, by the name of <hi>anger,</hi> and ſuſpect it of <hi>malicious, vile purpoſes,</hi> I wondred when I ſaw ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this folly in one that was her ſon once, but is run away from her ſorrow, and diſinherited himſelf becauſe ſhe was not able to give him a temporal portion, and thinks he hath found out reaſons enough to depart from the miſerable. I will not trouble him or ſo much as name him, becauſe if his words are as noted as they are publick every good man will ſcorn them, if they be private I am not willing to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh his ſhame, but leave him to conſideration and repentance; But for our dear afflicted Mother ſhe is under the portion of a child, in the ſtate of diſcipline, her government indeed hindered, but her worſhippings the ſame, the articles as true and thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as falſe as ever, of which I hope the following book will be one great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. But I wiſh that all tempted perſons would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the illogical deductions by which theſe men would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon their conſciences; If the Church of <hi>England</hi> be deſtroyed, then Tranſubſtantiation is true; which indeed had concluded well if that article had been only pretended falſe, becauſe the Church of <hi>England</hi> was proſperous. But put caſe the Turke ſhould invade <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſet up the Alcoran in S. <hi>Peters</hi> Church, would it be endured that we ſhould conclude, that <hi>Rome</hi> was Antichriſtian becauſe her temporal glory is defaced? The Apoſtle in this caſe argued otherwiſe; The Church of the Jewes was cut off for their ſinnes; be not highminded ô ye Gentiles, but fear leſt he alſo cut thee off; it was counſel given to the <hi>Romans.</hi> But though (bleſſed be God) our afflictions are great, yet we can, and doe enjoy the ſame religion as the good Chriſtians in the firſt three hundred years did theirs; we can ſerve God in our houſes, and ſometimes in Churches; and our faith which was not built upon temporal foundations, cannot be ſhaken by the convulſions of warre and the changes of ſtate. But
<pb facs="tcp:113292:7"/>they who make our afflictions an objection againſt us, unleſſe they have a promiſe that they ſhall never be afflicted, might doe weil to remember, that if they ever fall into trouble they have nothing left to repreſent or make their condition tolerable; for by pretending, religion is deſtroyed when it is perſecuted they take away all that which can ſupport their own Spirits and ſweeten perſecution: However, let our Church be where it pleaſes God it ſhall, it is certain that Tranſubſtantiation is an evil doctrine, falſe and dangerous and I know not any Church in Chriſtendome which hath any article more impoſſible or apt to render the Communion dangerous, then this in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and ſince they command us to believe all or will accept none, I hope the juſt reproof of this one will eſtabliſh the minds of thoſe who can be tempted to communicate with them in others. I have now given account of the reaſons of my preſent engagement; and though it may be enquired alſo why I preſented it to you, I fear I ſhall not give ſo perfect an account of it; becauſe thoſe excellent reaſons which invited me to this ſignification of my gratitude, are ſuch which although they ought to be made publick, yet I know not whether your humility will permit it: for you had rather oblige others then be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them. Your predeceſſor in the See of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> who was almoſt a Cardinal when he was almoſt dead, did publickly in thoſe evil times appear againſt the truth defended in this book, and yet he was more moderate and better tempered then the reſt: but becauſe God hath put the truth into the hearts and mouths of his ſucceſſors, it is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that to you ſhould be offered the opportunities of own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is the belief and honor of that See, ſince the religion was reformed. But leſt it be thought that this is an excuſe, rather then a reaſon of my addreſſe to you, I muſt crave pardon of your humility, and ſerve the end of glorification of God in it, by acknowledging publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that you have aſſiſted my condition by the emanations
<pb facs="tcp:113292:7"/>of that grace which is the Crown of Marytyrdome: expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the remains of your leſſened fortunes, and encreaſing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, upon your brethren who are dear to you not only by the band of the ſame Miniſtry, but the fellowſhip of the ſame ſufferings. But indeed the cauſe in which theſe papers are ingaged, is ſuch that it ought to be owned by them that can beſt defend it; and ſince the defence is not with ſecular arts and aids, but by Spiritual; the diminution of your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward circumſtances cannot render you a perſon unfit to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize this Book, becauſe where I fail, your wiſdome learning, and experience can ſupply, and therefore if you will pardon my drawing your name from the privacy of your retirement into a publick view: you will ſingularly oblige and increaſe thoſe favours by which you have already endeared the thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and ſervice of</p>

For as the man in <hi>Phadrus,</hi> that being asked what he carried hidden under his Cloak, Anſwered, it was hidden under his Cloak: meaning that he would not have hidden it, but that he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it ſhould be ſecret: ſo we may ſay in this myſtery to them that curiouſly ask, what, or how it is? <hi>Myſterium eſt;</hi> it is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and a Myſtery: by ſenſible inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it conſigns ſpiritual graces; by the creatures it brings us to God; by the body it miniſters to the ſpirit.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113292:11"/>not fit to be inquired after. This was their ſenſe: and I ſuppoſe we doe in no ſenſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate their ſo pious and prudent counſel by ſaying, <hi>the preſence of Chriſt is real and ſpiritual;</hi> becauſe this account does ſtill leave the article in his deepeſt myſtery: not onely becauſe ſpiritual formalities and perfections are undiſcernible and incommenſurable by natural proportions and the meaſures of our uſual notices of things, but alſo becauſe the word <hi>ſpiritual</hi> is ſo general a terme, and the operations ſo various and many by which the Spirit of God brings his purpoſes to paſſe, and does his work upon the ſoul, that we are in this ſpecific term very far from limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the article to a minute and ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Our word of <hi>ſpiritual preſence</hi> is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in nothing, but that it excludes the corporal and natural manner; we ſay it is not this, but it is to be underſtood figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is, not naturally, but to the purpoſes and in the manner of the Spirit and ſpiritual things; which how they operate or are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, we know no more then we know how a Cherubin ſings or thinks, or by what private conveyances a loſt notion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes ſuddenly into our memory and ſtands placed in the eye of reaſon.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113292:12"/>of his preſence, then the formality. For though we are taught and feel <hi>that,</hi> yet <hi>this</hi> we profeſſe we cannot underſtand; and therefore curiouſly inquire not. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>So far it was very well;

But they mean it otherwiſe, as I ſhall demonſtrate by and by. In the mean time it is remarkable that <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> when he is ſtating this queſtion, ſeems to ſay the ſame thing, for which he quotes the words of S. <hi>Bernard</hi> now mentioned;
<note place="margin">L 1. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char. c. 2.

For he intends not (for all theſe fine words) that Chriſts body is preſent <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> as the word is uſed in Scripture, and in all common notices of uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113292:16"/>ſpeaking; but <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> with him ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies after the manner of ſpirits, which, beſides that it is a couſening the world in the manner of expreſſion, is alſo a direct folly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, that a body ſhould be ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſent, that is, with the nature of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>naturally,</hi> and yet be not as a body but as a ſpirit, with that manner of being with which a ſpirit is diſtinguiſhed from a body. In vain therefore it is that he denies the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal manner, and admits a ſpiritual, and ever after requires that we beleive a carnal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, even in the very manner. But this caution and exactneſſe in the uſe of the word [ſpiritual] is therefore carefully to be obſerved, leſt the contention of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhould ſeem trifling and to be for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. We ſay that Chriſts body is in the Sacrament <hi>really,</hi> but <hi>ſpiritually.</hi> They ſay it is there <hi>really,</hi> but <hi>ſpiritually.</hi> For ſo <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> is bold to ſay, that the word may be allowed in this queſtion. Where now is the difference? Here, by [ſpiritually] they mean <hi>preſent after the manner of a ſpirit;</hi> by [ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally] we mean, <hi>preſent to our ſpirits onely;</hi> that is, ſo as Chriſt is not preſent to any other ſenſe but that of faith, or ſpiritual ſuſception; but their way makes his body to be preſent no way but that which is impoſſible and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a contradiction; a body not after the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113292:16"/>manner of a body, a body like a ſpirit; a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy without a body; and a ſacrifice of body and bloud, without bloud: <hi>corpus incorpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, cruor incruentus.</hi> They ſay that Chriſts body is truly preſent there as it was upon the Croſſe, but not after the manner of all or any body, but after that manner of being as an Angel is in a place. That's their <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</hi> But we by the <hi>real ſpiritual preſence</hi> of Chriſt doe underſtand, Chriſt to be preſent, as the Spirit of God is preſent in the hearts of the Faithful, by bleſſing and grace; and this is all which we mean beſides the <hi>tropical</hi> and <hi>figurative</hi> preſence.</p>

               <p>If it be ſaid,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that the Churches determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a better interpreter of Scripture then they; it is granted: But did the Church ever interpret Scripture to ſignifie Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, and ſay that by the force of the words of Scripture it was to be beleived? If ſhe did not, then to ſay ſhe is a better Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, is to no purpoſe; for though the Church be a better Interpreter then they, yet they did not contradict each other; and their ſenſe might be the ſenſe of the Church. But if the Church before their time had expounded it againſt their ſenſe, and they not ſubmit to it, how do you reckon them Catholicks, and not me? For it is certain if the Church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Scripture did declare it to ſignifie <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> they did not ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their writings to the Church. But if the Church had not in their times done it, and hath done it ſince, that is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration, and we are left to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that till <hi>Cajetans</hi> time, that is, till <hi>Luthers</hi> time, the Church had not declared
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:113292:22"/>that Scripture did prove Tranſubſtantiation; and ſince that time we know who hath; but not the Church Catholick.</p>
               <p>And indeed it had been ſtrange,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> if the Cardinals of <hi>Cambray, de Sancto vio</hi> and of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> that <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Biel</hi> ſhould never have heard that the Church had declared that the words of Scripture did inferre Tranſubſtantiation. And it is obſervable that all theſe lived long after the article it ſelf was ſaid to be decreed in the <hi>Lateran;</hi> where if the article it ſelf was declared, yet it was not declared as from Scripture; or if it was, they did not beleive it. But it is an uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al device amongſt their writers to ſtifle their reaſon, or to ſecure themſelves with a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the authority of their <hi>Church,</hi> even againſt their argument: and if any one ſpeaks a bold truth, he cannot eſcape the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition unleſſe he complement the <hi>Church,</hi> and with a civility tell her that ſhe knows better; which in plain Engliſh is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then the fellow that did penance for ſaying the Prieſt lay with his wife; he was forced to ſay, <hi>Tongue thou lieſt,</hi> though he was ſure his <hi>eyne did not lye.</hi> And this is that which <hi>Scotus</hi> ſaid; <hi>Tranſubſtantiation without the determination of the Church is not evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inferred from Scripture.</hi> This I ſay is a complement, and was onely to ſecure the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:113292:22"/>Frier from the Inquiſitors; or elſe was a direct ſtifling of his reaſon; for it contains in it a great error, or a worſe danger; For if the article be not contained ſo in Scripture as that we are bound to beleive it by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, then the Church muſt make a new article, or it muſt remain as it was; that is, obſcure; and we uncompeld and ſtill at liberty. For ſhe cannot <hi>declare</hi> unleſſe it be ſo; ſhe declares what is, or what is not: If what is not, ſhe declares a lie; if what is, then it is in Scripture before, and then we are compelled, that is, we ought to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived it. If it be ſaid it was there, but in it ſelf obſcurely; I anſwer, then ſo it is ſtill; for if it was obſcurely <hi>there,</hi> and not onely <hi>quoad nos,</hi> or by defect on our part, ſhe cannot ſay it is plain there; neither can ſhe alter it, for if ſhe ſees it plain, then it was plain: if it be obſcure, then ſhe ſees it obſcurely; for ſhe ſees it as it is, or elſe ſhe ſees it not at all; and therefore muſt declare it to be ſo; that is, probably, obſcurely, peradventure, but not evidently, compellingly, neceſſarily.</p>
               <p>So that if according to the Caſuiſts,

                  <hi>Solum igitur quaeſtio eſt de illis ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, [Fanis quem ego dabo, caro mea eſt pro mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divitâ] &amp; de ſequentibus, fere ad finem capitis.</hi> The queſtion onely is concerning thoſe words verſe 51. <hi>The bread which I will give is my fleſh which I will give for the life of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:113292:23"/>world</hi>] and ſo forward almoſt untill the end of the chapter. The reaſon which is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for it, is, becauſe Chriſt ſpeaks in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore probably relates to the inſtitution which was to be next year: but this is a trifle; for the ſame thing in effect is before ſpoken in the future tenſe, and by way of promiſe;

                  <hi>Labour not for the meat that periſheth, but for that meat that endureth to everlaſting life, which the Son of man ſhall give unto you.</hi> The ſame alſo is affirmed by Chriſt under the expreſſion of water, S. <hi>John</hi> 4.14. <hi>He that drinketh the water which I ſhall give him ſhall never thirſt; but the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which I ſhall give him ſhall be a fountain of water ſpringing up to life eternal;</hi> The places are exactly parallel; and yet as this is not meant of Baptiſme, ſo neither is the other of the Euchariſt; but both of them of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſumption of Chriſt. And both of them being promiſes to them that ſhall come to Chriſt and be united to him, it were ſtrange if they were not expreſſed in the future; for although they always did ſignifie in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and <hi>in ſenſu currenti,</hi> yet becauſe they are of never failing truth, to expreſſe them in the future is moſt proper, that the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them may appertain to all,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ad natos natorum &amp; qui naſcentur ab illis.</hi> But then, becauſe Chriſt ſaid, <hi>[The bread

                  <hi>[To him that overcomes I will give to eat of the tree of life:]</hi> and <hi>[To him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes I will give to eate of the hidden Manna:]</hi> Theſe promiſes are future, but certainly fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative; and therefore why it may not be ſo here, and be underſtood of eating Chriſt ſpiritually or by faith, I am certain there is no cauſe ſufficient in this excuſe.

If in the ſacramental body, Chriſt gave the bloud by concomitancy, then he gave the bloud twice; which to what purpoſe it might be done is not yet revealed. 4. If the bloud be by concomitancy in the body, then ſo is the body with the bloud; and then it will be ſufficient to drink the chalice without the hoſt, as to eat the hoſt without the chalice; and then we muſt drink his fleſh as well as eat his bloud; which if we could ſuppoſe to be poſſible, yet the precept of eating his fleſh, and drinking his bloud, were not obſerved by drinking that which is to be eaten, and

Fools, young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they that are ſurpriſed with ſudden death cannot be thought to periſh for want of the actual ſuſception or deſire. 3. There is nothing in the words that can warrant or excuſe the actual omiſſion of the Sacrament, and it is a ſtrange deception that theſe men ſuffer by miſunderſtanding this diſtinction of receiving the Sacrament <hi>either in act or deſire.</hi> For, they are not <hi>oppoſite,</hi> but <hi>ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate</hi> members, differ only as act and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and this diſpoſition is not at all required but as it is in order to the act, and therefore is nothing of it ſelf, and is onely
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:113292:27"/>the imperfection of, or paſſage to the act; if therefore the act were not neceſſary, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were the diſpoſition; but if the act be neceſſary, then the deſire which is but the diſpoſition to the act is not ſufficient. As if it be neceſſary, to go from <hi>Oxford</hi> to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> then it is neceſſary that you go to <hi>Henly,</hi> or <hi>Uxbridge;</hi> but if it be neceſſary to be at <hi>London,</hi> it is not ſufficient to go to <hi>Uxbridge;</hi> but if it be not neceſſary to be at <hi>London,</hi> neither is it neceſſary to go ſo far. But this diſtinction as it is commonly uſed is made to ſerve ends, and is grown to that inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that repentance it ſelf is ſaid to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, if it be onely in deſire; for ſo they muſt, that affirme repentance in the article of death after a wicked life to be ſufficient; when it is certain there can be nothing actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al but ineffective deſires; and all the real and moſt material events of it cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but deſired onely. But whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can be excuſed from the actual ſuſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of a Sacrament, can alſo in an equal neceſſity be excuſed from the deſire; and no man can be tied to an abſolute, irreſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive deſire of that which cannot be had; and if it can, the deſire alone will not ſerve the turn. And indeed a deſire of a thing when we know it cannot be had, is a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation either to impatience, or a ſcruple;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:113292:27"/>and why, or how can a man be obliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that to be done, which in all his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances is not neceſſary it ſhould be done. A preparation of mind to obey in thoſe circumſtances in which it is poſſible, that is, in which he is obliged, is the duty of every man; but this is not an explicite deſire of the actual ſuſception, which in his caſe, is not obligatory, becauſe it is impoſſible; And laſtly, ſuch a deſire of a thing, is wholly needleſſe, becauſe in the preſent caſe, the thing it ſelf is not neceſſary; therefore neither is the deſire; neither did God ever require it but in order to the act. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever if we find by diſcourſe that for all theſe decretory words, the deſire can ſuffice, I demand by what inſtrument is that acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted; whether by faith, or no?

But if it be not deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then a ſpiritual manducation can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the duty of thoſe words: for ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacrament in deſire is at the moſt but a ſpiritual manducation.

               <p>And becauſe it is here opportune by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this diſcourſe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> let me obſerve this, that the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation is infinitely uſeleſſe, and to no purpoſe; For by the words of our Bleſſed Lord, by the doctrine of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the ſenſe of the Church, and the confeſſion of all ſides, the <hi>natural</hi> eating of Chriſts fleſh, (if it were there, or could ſo be eaten) alone or of it ſelf does no good, does not give life; but
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:113292:32"/>the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> eating of him is the inſtrument of life to us; and this may be done without their Tranſubſtantiated fleſh; it may be done in Baptiſme, by faith, and charity, by hearing, and underſtanding, and therefore it may alſo in the Bleſſed Euchariſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>there</hi> alſo according to our doctrine he be eaten onely Sacramentally,
<note place="margin">Ser. 6.4. temp. Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tembr. poſt conſecrat.</note> and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually. And hence it is that in the Maſſe book anciently it is prayed after conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Quaeſumus Omnipotens Deus, ut de per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptis muneribus gratias exhibentes beneficia potiora ſumamus</hi>] We beſeech thee Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, that we giving thanks for <hi>theſe gifts</hi> received may receive <hi>greater gifts</hi>] which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that it concludes againſt the Natural preſence of Chriſts body, (for what greater thing can we receive, if we receive <hi>that?</hi>) it alſo declares that the <hi>grace and effect</hi> of the Sacramental communion is the thing deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond all <hi>corporal</hi> ſumption:
<note place="margin">In Miſſ. vol. <hi>pro quacunque neceſſitate.</hi>
                  </note> and as it is more fully expres'd in another collect <hi>[ut terrenis affectibus expiati ad ſuperni pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem Sacramenti, cujus libavimus ſancta, tendamus]</hi> that being redeemed from all earthly affections we may tend to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the heavenly Sacrament, the Holy things of which we have now begun to taſt. And therefore to multiply ſo many miracles and contradictions and impoſſibilities to no
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:113292:33"/>purpoſe, is an inſuperable prejudice againſt any pretence, leſſe then a plain declaration from God. Adde to this, that this bodily preſence of Chriſts body is either for <hi>corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> nouriſhment, or for <hi>ſpiritual:</hi> Not for Corporal; for Natural food is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for it; and to work a miracle to do that, for which ſo many Natural means are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy appointed, is to no purpoſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be ſuppoſed to be done by God; neither is it done for <hi>ſpiritual</hi> nouriſhment: becauſe <hi>to the ſpiritual nouriſhment,</hi> virtues and graces, the word and the efficacious ſignes, faith and the inward actions, and all the emanations of the Spirit are as propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, as meat and drink are <hi>to natural nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment;</hi> and therefore there can be no need of a Corporal preſence. 2. Corporal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation of Chriſts body is apparently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the nature and condition of the body. 1. Becauſe that which is after the manner of a ſpirit, and not of a body, cannot be eaten and drunk after the manner of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but of a ſpirit; as no man can eat a Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin with his mouth, if he were made apt to nouriſh the ſoul: but by the confeſſion of the Roman Doctors, Chriſts body is preſent in the Euchariſt after the manner of a ſpirit, therefore without proportions to our body, or bodily actions. 2. That which neither
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:113292:33"/>can feel, or be felt, ſee or be ſeen, move or be mov'd, change or be changed, neither do nor ſuffer corporally, cannot certainly be eaten corporally; but ſo they affirme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the body of our Bleſſed Lord; it cannot do or ſuffer corporally in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore it cannot be eaten corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, any more then a man can chew a ſpirit, or eate a meditation, or ſwallow a ſyllogiſme into his belly. This would be ſo far from being credible, that God ſhould work ſo many miracles in placing Chriſts Natural body for ſpiritual nouriſhment, that in caſe it were revealed, to be placed there to that purpoſe, it ſelf muſt need one great mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle more to verify it, and reduce it to act; and it would ſtill be as difficult to explain, as it is to tell how the material fire of hell ſhould torment ſpirits and ſouls. And <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> in <hi>Plato's</hi> banquet ſaid well; <hi>Wiſdome is not a thing that can be communicated by local or corporal contiguity.</hi> 3. That the corporal preſence does not nouriſh ſpiritually, appears; becauſe ſome are nouriſhed ſpiritually, who do not receive the Sacrament at all, and ſome that do receive, yet fall ſhort of being ſpiritually nouriſhed, and ſo do all unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy communicants. This therefore is to no purpoſe; and therefore cannot be ſuppoſed to be done by the wiſe God of all the world,

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:113292:37"/>of any other myſtery, of this amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; that is of all the wayes of taking him, is to me highly probable: Chriſt is the food of our ſouls; this food we receive in at our ears, our mouth, our hearts; and the allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is plainer in the Sacrament then in any other externall rite, becauſe of the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>bread,</hi> and <hi>eating</hi> which Chriſt uſed upon occaſion of the miracle of the loaves, which introduc'd all that diſcourſe.

<note place="margin">De Euchar. l. 1. c. 7. &amp; ad alios patres.</note> and therefore the ſaying of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> that they onely give the myſtical ſenſe, is one of his confident ſayings without reaſon, or pretence of proof: and whereas he adds that they do not deny that theſe words are alſo underſtood literally of the Sacrament;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:113292:38"/>I anſwer, it is ſufficient, that they agree in this ſenſe: and the other Fathers do ſo expound it with an <hi>excluſion to the natural ſenſe</hi> of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt in the Sacrament; particularly this appears in the teſtimonies of <hi>Origen</hi> and S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> above quoted: to which I adde the words of <hi>Euſebius</hi> in the 3<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> book of his <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logia Eccleſiaſtica,</hi> expounding the 63. verſe of the 6. of <hi>John;</hi> he brings in Chriſt ſpeaking thus. <hi>Think not that I ſpeak of this fleſh which I bear; and do not imagine that I appoint you to drink this ſenſible and corporal bloud. But know ye, that the words which I have ſpoken are ſpirit and life.</hi> Nothing can be fuller to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude their interpretation, and to affirme ours: though to do ſo be not uſual, unleſſe they were to expound Scripture in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to an adverſary; and to require ſuch hard conditions in the ſayings of men, that when they ſpeak againſt <hi>Titius</hi> they ſhall be concluded not to ſpeak againſt <hi>Cajus,</hi> if they do not clap their contrary negative to their poſitive affirmative, though <hi>Titius</hi> and <hi>Cajus</hi> be againſt one another in the cauſe, is a device to eſcape rather then to intend truth and reality in the diſcourſes of men. I conclude; It is notorious and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent what <hi>Eraſmus</hi> notes upon this place, <hi>Hunc locum veteres interpretantur de doctrìnâ coeleſti: ſic enim dicit panem ſuum, ut frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:113292:39"/>dixit ſermonem ſuum.</hi> The Ancient Fathers expound this place of the heavenly doctrine: So he calls the bread <hi>his own</hi> as he ſaid often <hi>the word</hi> to be <hi>his.</hi> And if the concurrent teſtimonies of <hi>Origen, Tertullian, Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> S. <hi>Baſil, Athanaſius, Euſebius,</hi> S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> S. <hi>Auſtin, Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact,</hi> and S. <hi>Bernard</hi> are a good ſecurity for the ſenſe of a place of Scripture, we have read their evidence, and may proceed to ſentence.</p>
               <p>But it was impoſſible,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> but theſe words falling upon the allegory of bread and drink, and ſignifying the receiving Chriſt crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and communicating with his paſſion in all the ways of faith and Sacrament, ſhould alſo meet with as allegoricall expounders, and for the likeneſſe of expreſſion be refer'd to ſacramental manducation; And yet I ſaid this cannot at all infer Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though ſacramental manducation were onely and principally intended. For if it had been ſpoken of the Sacrament, the words had been verified in the ſpiritual ſumption of it; for as Chriſt is eaten by faith out of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, ſo is he alſo in the Sacrament: as he is real and ſpiritual meat to the worthy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, ſo is he to the worthy communicant: as Chriſts fleſh is life to all that obey hm, ſo to all that obediently remember him; ſo Chriſts
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:113292:39"/>fleſh is meat indeed, however it be taken, if it be taken ſpiritually, but not however it be taken, if it be taken carnally; He is nutritive in all the ways of ſpiritual manducation, but not in all the ways of natural eating, by their own confeſſion, nor in any, by ours. And therefore it is a vain confidence to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the concluſion, if they ſhould gain one of the premiſes; But the truth is this: It is neither properly ſpoken of the Sacrament, neither if it were, would it prove any thing of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>

               <p>Laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> ſuppoſe theſe words of Chriſt [the bread which I ſhall give is my fleſh] were ſpoken literally of the Sacrament; what he promiſed he would give, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, and what was here expreſſed in the future tenſe, was in his time true in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent tenſe, and therefore is always preſently true after conſecration; It followes, that in the Sacrament this is true; <hi>panis eſt corpus Chriſti,</hi> The bread is the body of Chriſt. Now I demand whether this propoſition will be owned. It followes inevitably from this doctrine, If theſe words be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Sacrament.

If it did not ſo come to paſſe, and that it is impoſſible that bread ſhould be Chriſts fleſh; then, when Chriſt ſaid the bread which he would give ſhould be his fleſh, he was not to be underſtood properly of the Sacrament; But either figuratively in the Sacrament, or in the Sacrament not at all; either of which will ſerve the end of truth in this queſtion.

               <p>Theſe words contain the Inſtitution,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and are uſually called the words of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration in the Latine Church. Concerning which the conſideration is material. Out of theſe words the Latine Church ſeparates, <hi>[Hoc eſt corpus meum] This is my body,]</hi> and ſay that theſe words pronounced by the Prieſt with due intention, doe effect this change of the bread into Chriſts body, which change they call <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> But if theſe words do not effect any ſuch change, then it may be Chriſts body before the words, and theſe may only declare what is already done by the prayers of the Holy man; or elſe it may become Chriſts body only in the uſe and manducation: and as it will be uncertain when the change is, ſo alſo it cannot be known what it is. If it be Chriſts body before thoſe words, then the literal ſenſe of theſe words will prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, it is ſo as it will be before theſe words, and made ſo by other words which refer wholly to uſe; and then the <hi>praecipuum fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum</hi> the pillar and ground of <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> is ſupplanted. And if it be only after the words and not effected by the words, it will be Chriſts body only in the reception. Now concerning this I have theſe things to ſay:</p>
               <p n="1">1 By what argument can it be proved
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:113292:43"/>that theſe words <hi>[Take, and eat]</hi> are not as effective of the change, as <hi>[Hoc eſt corpus meum, This is my body?]</hi> If they be, then the taking and eating does conſecrate: and it is not Chriſts body till it be taken and eaten, and then when that's done it is ſo no more; and beſides, that reſervation, circumgeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, adoration, elevation of it muſt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fall to the ground; it will alſo follow that it is Chriſts body only in a myſtical, ſpiritual and ſacramental manner.</p>
               <p n="2">2 By what argument will it ſo much as probably be concluded that theſe words <hi>[This is my body]</hi> ſhould be the words ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective of converſion and conſecration?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> That Chriſt uſed theſe words is true, and ſo he uſed all the other; but did not tell which were the conſecrating words, nor appoint them to uſe thoſe words; but to do the thing, and ſo to remember and repreſent his death.

               <p n="6">6 And it is conſiderable,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> that ſince the miniſteries of the Church are but imitations of Chriſts Prieſthood which he officiates in heaven, ſince he effects all the purpoſes of his graces and our redemption by interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and repreſenting in the way of prayer the ſacrifice which he offered on the Croſs: it follows that the miniſteries of the Church muſt be of the ſame kind, operating in the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:113292:46"/>way of prayer, morally, and therefore whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to moral purpoſes; to which the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is made proportionable. And if theſe words which are called the words of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration be exegetical, and enunciative of the change that is made by prayers, and other myſtical words; it cannot be poſſibly infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from theſe words that there is any other change made then what refers to the whole myſterie and action: and therefore, <hi>Take, eat,</hi> and <hi>this doe,</hi> are as neceſſary to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament as <hi>[Hoc eſt corpus]</hi> and declare that it is Chriſts body only in the uſe and adminiſtration; and therefore not <hi>natural</hi> but <hi>ſpiritual.</hi> And this is yet more plain by the words in the Hebrew Text of S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, Take, eat this which is my body,</hi> plainly ſuppoſing the thing to be done already; not by the exegetical words, but by the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, the myſtic prayer, and the words of inſtitution and uſe; and to this I never ſaw any thing pretended in anſwer. But the force of the Argument upon ſuppoſition of the premiſes is acknowledged to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing by an Archbiſhop of their own,
<note place="margin">Archiep. Caeſar. Tractat. varii diſp. de neceſ. correct. Theol. Schol.</note>

                     <hi>If Chriſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Euchariſt did conſecrate (as Scotus affirmed) then the Lutherans will carry the victory, who maintain that the body of Chriſt is in the Euchariſt only, while it is uſed, while

                  </q> So that in effect, whether it was conſecrated by thoſe words or not by thoſe words, their new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is deſtroyed. If it was not conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Take, eat,</hi> then Chriſt bid them take bread, and eat bread, and they did ſo: But if it was conſecrated by thoſe words, <hi>Take, eat,</hi> then the words of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration refer wholly to uſe, and it is Chriſts body only in the <hi>Taking</hi> and <hi>eating,</hi> which is the thing we contend for.

<note place="margin">De Euch. l. 1. c. 11.</note> For to avoid Chriſts giving the Apoſtles that which <hi>he took,</hi> and <hi>brake,</hi> and <hi>bleſſed,</hi> that is, <hi>bread,</hi> the ſame caſe being governed by all theſe words; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>Dominum accepiſſe, &amp; benedixiſſe panem, ſed dediſſe panem non vulgarem, ſed benedictum &amp; benedictione mutatum:</hi> The Lord took bread and bleſſed it, but he gave not common bread, but bread bleſſed and changed by bleſſing; and yet it is certain he gave it them before the words, which he calls the words of Conſecration.

So careleſſe are theſe <hi>opiniators</hi> of what they ſay, that rather then their own
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:113292:50"/>fond opinions ſhould be confuted, they care not to impute non-ſenſe to <hi>the eternal Wiſdom of the Father.</hi> And yet that Chriſt did ſay this of bread ſo ordered and to be uſed, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> beſides that the thing is notorious, I ſhall prove moſt evidently.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That which Chriſt broke,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> which he gave to his diſciples, which he bid them eat, that he affirmed was <hi>his body.</hi> What gave he but what he broke? what did he break, but that which he took? what did he take? <hi>accepit panem</hi> (ſaith the Scripture) he took bread, therefore of bread it was that he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>It was his body.</hi> Now the Roman Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors will by no means endure this; for if of bread he affirmed it to be his body; then we have cleared the Queſtion, for it is bread and Chriſts body too; that is, it is <hi>bread naturally,</hi> and <hi>Chriſts body ſpiritually;</hi> for that it cannot be both <hi>naturally,</hi> they unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly affirm. And we are ſure upon this Article: for <hi>diſparatum de diſparato non prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatur propriè;</hi> It is a rule of nature and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential reaſon, If it be bread it is not a ſtone, if it be a Mouſe it is not a Mule; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when there is any praedication made of one diverſe thing by another, the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt needs be improper and figurative.
<note place="margin">De conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat. diſt. 2. c. quia.</note> And the Gloſſe of <hi>Gratian</hi> diſputes it well, <hi>If bread be the body of Chriſt</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> properly
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:113292:50"/>and naturally) <hi>then ſomething that is not born of the Virgin Mary is the body of Chriſt; and the body of Chriſt ſhould be both alive and dead.</hi> Now that <hi>[Hoc, This]</hi> points to bread, beſides the notoriouſneſs of the thing in the ſtory of the Goſpels, in the matter of fact, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> calling it <hi>bread</hi> ſo often, (as I ſhall ſhew in the ſequel) it ought to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Roman Doctors, and confeſſed, becauſe by their doctrines when Chriſt ſaid <hi>Hoc, This</hi>] and <hi>a while after,</hi> it was bread; becauſe it was not conſecrated till the laſt ſyllable was ſpoken. To avoid this therefore, they turn themſelves into all the opinions and diſguiſes that can be deviſed.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:113292:51"/>
                  <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, <hi>Major,</hi> the Count of <hi>Mirandula, De capite Fontium,</hi> and <hi>Cathari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> Others yet affirm, that [This] ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, <hi>theſe accidents.</hi> So <hi>Ruard Tapper,</hi> and others whom <hi>Suarez</hi> reckons and confutes. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> and his Scholars affirm that This] demonſtrates neither bread nor the body, nor <hi>nothing,</hi> nor the <hi>accidents,</hi> but a ſubſtance indefinitely, which is under the accidents of bread; as when Chriſt turned the water into wine, he might have ſaid <hi>Hoc eſt vinum,</hi> not meaning that <hi>water is wine,</hi> but this which is here, or this which is in the veſſel is wine, which is an inſtance in which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> pleaſes himſelf very much and uſes it more then once, not at all conſidering that in this form of ſpeech, there is the ſame miſtake as in the former: for in this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there are not two things, as we contend there are in the Sacrament; and that to make up the propoſition, the underſtanding is forc'd to make an artificial ſubject; and <hi>[this]</hi> refers to wine, and is determined by his imaginary ſubject, and makes not an <hi>eſſential</hi> or <hi>phyſical,</hi> but <hi>a logical praedication; This which is in the veſſel is wine:</hi> and the propoſition is <hi>identical,</hi> if it be reduc'd to a <hi>ſubſtantial.</hi> But when Chriſt ſaid <hi>[Hoc eſt corpus meum] hoc]</hi> firſt, neither points to <hi>corpus</hi> as the other does to <hi>vinum,</hi> even by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:113292:51"/>their own confeſſion; nor yet, ſecondly, to an artificial ſubject, whereby it can by ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination become demonſtrative, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate; for then it were no real affirmative, not at all ſignificative, much leſs effective of a change: nor yet, thirdly, will they allow that it points to that ſubject which is really there, viz. <hi>bread;</hi> but what then? It demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ſomething real, that either 1. is not the predicate, and then there would be two things diſparate ſignified by it, two diſtinct ſubſtances, which in this caſe could be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but bread and the body of Chriſt: or 2. it demonſtrates nothing but the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and then the propoſition were <hi>identical,</hi> viz. <hi>this body of Chriſt is the body of Chriſt;</hi> which is an abſurd praedication: or elſe 3. it demonſtrates ſomething that is <hi>indemon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable,</hi> pointing at <hi>ſomething</hi> that is <hi>nothing certain,</hi> and then it cannot be pointed at or <hi>demonſtrated;</hi> for if by <hi>this which is under the ſpecies,</hi> they mean any certain ſubſtance, it muſt be <hi>bread</hi> or <hi>the body of Chriſt,</hi> either of which undoes their cauſe.</p>
               <p>But if it be inquired,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> by what Logick or Grammar it can be, that a <hi>Pronounce demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s;trative</hi> ſhould ſignifie <hi>indeterminately,</hi> that is, an <hi>individuum vagum:</hi> They tell us, no; it does not: but it ſignifies an <hi>individual, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate ſubſtance under the accidents of bread,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:113292:52"/>not according to the formality of the bread,

It is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and not determinate, it is a ſubſtance in order to accidents, individual and yet common, univerſal and particular, it is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, but after an unlimited manner; that is, it is and it is not; that is, it is the Logick, and the Grammar, and the proper ſenſe of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> which is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood but by them that know the new and ſecret way: to reconcile contradictories. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſweetens the ſenſe of this as well as he may, and ſayes that the Pronoune de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative does point out and demonſtrate the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> that is, the accidents of bread; theſe accidents are certain and determinate;
<note place="margin">L. 1. Euch. c. 11. §. ad id verò.</note> ſo that the Pronoune demonſtrative is on the ſide of the ſpecies or accidents, not of the ſubſtance. But yet ſo as to mean not the accidents, but the ſubſtance, and not the ſubſtance which is, but which ſhall be; for it is not the ſame yet: which indeed is the ſame non-ſenſe with the former, abuſed or ſet off with a diſtinction, the parts of which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:113292:52"/>contradict each other. The Pronoune de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative does only point to the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and yet does not mean the accidents, but the ſubſtance under them; and yet it does not mean the ſubſtance that is under them, but that which ſhall be; for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which is meant is not yet: and it does not point at the ſubſtance, but yet it means it: For the ſubſtance indeed is meant by the Pronoune demonſtrative, but that it does not at all demonſtrate <hi>it,</hi> but the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents only. And indeed this is a fine ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret: The ſubſtance is pointed at before it is, and the demonſtration is upon the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, but means the ſubſtance, <hi>in obliquo,</hi> but not <hi>in recto;</hi> not directly, but as by the by; juſt as a man can ſee a thing before it be made, and by pointing at a thing which you ſee, demonſtrates or ſhews you a thing which ſhall never be ſeen. But then if you deſire to know how it was pointed at before it was, that is the ſecret not yet revealed. But finally this is the doctrine that hath prevailed at leaſt in the Jeſuites Schooles. <hi>This</hi>] points out ſomething under the accidents of bread, meaning, <hi>This which is contained under the accidents of bread is my body:</hi> there it reſts. But before it go any further I ſhall diſturb his reſt with this Syllogiſm: When Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Hoc, this is my body;</hi> by This] he meant
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:113292:53"/>
                  <hi>this which is contained under the accidents of bread, is my body.</hi> But at that inſtant, that which was contained under the accidents of bread, was the ſubſtance of bread; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the ſubſtance of bread Chriſt point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>that</hi> he related to by the Pronoune de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative, and <hi>of that</hi> he affirmed, it was <hi>his body.</hi> The Major is that the Jeſuites contend for: the Minor is affirmed by <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine, Quando dicitur [Hoc] tum non eſt praeſens ſubſtantia corporis Chriſti:</hi> therefore the concluſion ought to be his and owned by them. However I will make bold to call it a. demonſtration upon their own grounds, and conclude that it is bread and Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy too; and that is the doctrine of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. And I adde this alſo, that it ſeems a great folly to declaim againſt us for deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the literal, natural ſenſe, and yet that themſelves ſhould expound it in a ſenſe which ſuffers a violence and a moſt unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ungrammatical torture; for if they may change the words from the right <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>caſe</hi> to the <hi>oblique</hi> and <hi>indirect,</hi> why may not we? And it is leſſe violence to ſay <hi>[Hoc eſt corpus meum]</hi> i. e. <hi>hic panis eſt corpus meum;</hi> viz. <hi>ſpiritualitèr:</hi> then to ſay, <hi>hoc eſt,</hi> that is, <hi>ſub his ſpeciebus eſt corpus meum.</hi> And this was the ſenſe of
<note n="*" place="margin">In 4. qu 6</note> 
                  <hi>Ocham</hi> the Father of the <hi>Nominaliſts:</hi> It may be held that under the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 1. That the holy Euchariſt, or the ſacred body is called [bread] becauſe <hi>it is made of bread;</hi> as <hi>Eve</hi> is called of <hi>Adam,</hi> bone of his bone; and the rods changed into ſerpents are ſtill called rods; or elſe becauſe <hi>it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:113292:56"/>was bread,</hi> therefore ſo it is called after: juſt as we ſay, The blind ſee, the lame walk, the harlots enter into the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
<note place="margin">L. 1. c. 14. de Euchar.</note> Which anſwer although <hi>Bellarmine</hi> miſlikes, yet leſt any others ſhould be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with it, I have this certain confutation of it; that by the Roman doctrine the bread is wholly annihilated, and nothing of the bread becomes any thing of the holy body; and the holy body never was bread, not ſo much as the matter of bread remaining in the change. It cannot therefore be called bread, unleſſe it be bread; at leaſt not for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For if the body of Chriſt be not bread then, <hi>neither ever was it bread, neither was it made of bread;</hi> and therefore theſe cannot be the reaſons, becauſe they are not true. But in the inſtances alleged, the denomination ſtill remains, becauſe the change was made in the ſame remaining matter, or in the ſame perſon, or they were to be ſo again as they were before; nothing of which can be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Euchariſt, by their doctrine, therefore theſe inſtances are not pertinent. 2. Others anſwer, that the holy Body is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Bread, becauſe it ſeems to be ſo: juſt as the effigies and forms of Pomegranates, of Buls, of Serpents, of Cherubims, are called by the names of thoſe creatures whom they do reſemble. I reply, that well they may,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:113292:56"/>becauſe there is <hi>there</hi> no danger of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by ſuch appellations, no man will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them other then the pictures, and ſo to ſpeak is uſual and common. But in the matter of the holy Euchariſt it ought not to be called <hi>bread</hi> for the likeneſſe to bread, unleſſe it were bread indeed; becauſe ſuch likeneſſe and ſuch appellation are both of them a temptation againſt that which theſe men call an article of faith: but rather becauſe it is like bread, and all the world are apt to take it for ſuch, it ought to have been deſcribed with caution, and affirmed to be <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> and not to be bread though it ſeem ſo. But when it is often called Bread in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which name the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does not at all uſe in the myſterie, and is never called in Scripture, the Son of God, or God, or Chriſt; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> words the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does often uſe in the myſterie; it is certain that it is called bread, not becauſe it is like bread, but becauſe it is ſo indeed. * And indeed upon ſuch an anſwer as this, it is eaſie to affirm an apple to be a Pigeon, and no apple; for if it be urged that all the world calls it an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it may be replyed then as now, It is true they call it an apple, becauſe it is like an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but indeed it is a Pigeon. 3. Some of them ſay when it is called <hi>bread,</hi> is not meant that particular kind of nouriſhment; but in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:113292:57"/>general it means any food; and ſo only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents Chriſts body as a coeleſtial divine thing intended ſome way to be our food. Juſt, as in S. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. Chriſt is called the bread that came down from heaven, not meaning material bread, but divine nouriſhment. But this is the weakeſt of all, becauſe this which is called bread is broken, is eaten, hath the accidents of bread, and all the ſigns of his proper nature; and it were a ſtrange vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence that it ſhould here ſignifie any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of food to which it is not like, and not ſignifie that to which it is ſo like. * Beſides this, <hi>bread</hi> here ſignifies, as wine or chalice does in the following words; now that did ſignifie the <hi>fruit of the Vine,</hi> that ſpecial manner of drink (Chriſt himſelf being the Interpreter) and therefore ſo muſt this mean that ſpecial manner of food.</p>
               <p n="6">6 If after the bleſſing the bread does not remain,

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:113292:57"/>muſt yet change it to the better; and ſo we affirm he does: for the bread beſides the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural being, by being bleſſed becomes the body of Chriſt in a ſacramental manner; but then it muſt remain bread ſtill, or elſe it receives not that increaſe and change; but if it be annihilated and becomes nothing, it is not Chriſts body in any ſenſe, nor in any ſenſe can pretend to be bleſſed.

But it is natural food ſtill, and that for two reaſons. 1. Becauſe ſtill he calls it <hi>bread,</hi> not <hi>common bread,</hi> but extraordinary, yet bread ſtill. Card. <hi>Perron</hi> ſayes, it follows not to ſay, it is not common bread, therefore it is bread; ſo as of thoſe which appeared as men to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> we might ſay they were not common men; but it follows not that they were men at all. So the holy Ghoſt deſcending like a Dove upon the bleſſed Jeſus, was no common Dove; and yet it follows not it was a Dove at all. I reply to this, that of whatſoever you can ſay, it is extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in his kind, of that you may alſo affirm it to be of that kind: as concerning the richeſt ſcarlet, if you ſay this is no ordinary colour, you ſuppoſe it to be a colour: ſo the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> braſſe was no common braſſe, and the <hi>Coloſſus</hi> was no common Statue, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:113292:58"/>Chriſtmas day is no common day, yet theſe negatives ſuppoſe the affirmative of their proper ſubject; <hi>Corinthian</hi> braſſe is braſſe, <hi>Coloſſus</hi> is a ſtatue, and Chriſtmas day is a day. But if you affirm of a counterfeit, or of an image or a picture, by ſaying it is no common thing, you deny to it the ordinary nature by diminution; but if it have the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing, then to ſay it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, denies the <hi>ordinary</hi> nature by addition and eminencie; the firſt ſayes it is not ſo at all, the ſecond ſayes it is more then ſo; and this is taught to every man by common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and he could have obſerved it if he had pleaſed; for it is plain, <hi>Juſtin</hi> ſaid this of that, which before the Conſecration was known to be natural bread, and therefore now to ſay it was not common bread, is to ſay it is bread and ſomething more. 2. The ſecond reaſon from the words of <hi>Juſtin</hi> to prove it to be natural food ſtill, is becauſe it is that by which our bloud and our fleſh is nouriſhed by change. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſayes, that theſe words, by which our fleſh and bloud is nouriſhed, mean by which they uſe to be nouriſhed; not meaning that they are nouriſhed by this bread when it is Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſtical. But beſides that this is <hi>gratis dictum</hi> without any colour or pretence from the words of <hi>Juſtin,</hi> but by a preſumption
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:113292:59"/>taken from his own opinion, as if it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that <hi>Juſtin</hi> ſhould mean any thing againſt his doctrine: beſides this I ſay the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation is inſolent, <hi>Nutriuntur,</hi> i.e. <hi>ſolent nutriri;</hi> as alſo becauſe both the verbs are of the preſent tenſe, <gap reason="foreign">

But if the bread does not remain bread, but be changed by bleſſing into our Lords body; this alſo is impoſſible to be in any ſenſe true, but by affirming the change to be only in uſe, virtue and condition, with which change the natural being of bread may remain. For, he that ſuppoſes that by the bleſſing, the bread ceaſes ſo to be, that nothing of it remains, muſt alſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſuppoſe that the bread being no more, it neither can be the body of Chriſt, nor any thing elſe. For it is impoſſible that what is taken abſolutely from all being, ſhould yet abide under a certain difference of being,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:113292:62"/>and that that thing which is not at all, ſhould yet be after a certain manner. Since therefore (as I have proved) the bread remains, and of bread it was affirmed [This is my body] it follows inevitably that it is figuratively, not properly and naturally ſpoken of bread, That it is the fleſh or body of our Lord.</p>

               <p>THe next words to be conſidered are <hi>[Eſt corpus]</hi> This is my body;] and here begins the firſt Tropical expreſſion; <hi>[Eſt,]</hi> that is, <hi>ſignificat</hi> or <hi>repraeſentat, &amp; exhibet cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus meum,</hi> ſay ſome. <hi>This is my body,</hi> it is to all real effects the ſame to your particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which my body is to all the Church: it ſignifies the breaking of my body, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of my bloud for you, and applies my paſſion to you, and conveyes to you all the benefits; as this nouriſhes your bodies, ſo my body nouriſhes your ſouls to life eternal, and conſigns your bodies to immortality. Others make the trope in <hi>Corpus;</hi> ſo that <hi>Eſt</hi> ſhall ſignifie properly, but <hi>Corpus</hi> is taken in a ſpiritual ſenſe, ſacramental and myſterious; not a natural and praeſential:
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:113292:62"/>whether the figure be in <hi>Eſt</hi> or in <hi>Corpus,</hi> is but a quaeſtion of Rhetorick, and of no effect. That the propoſition is tropical and figurative is the thing, and that Chriſts na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body is now in heaven definitively, and no where elſe; and that he is in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament as he can be in a Sacrament, in the hearts of faithful receivers, as he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be there; that is, in the Sacrament myſtically, operatively, as in a morall and divine inſtrument, in the hearts of receivers by faith and bleſſing; this is the truth and the faith of which we are to give a reaſon and account to them that diſagree. But this which is to all the purpoſe which any one pretends can be in the ſumption of Chriſts body naturally, yet will not pleaſe the Romaniſts, unleſſe <hi>[Eſt, Is]</hi> ſignifie properly without <hi>trope</hi> or <hi>metonymie,</hi> and <hi>corpus</hi> be <hi>corpus naturale.</hi> Here then I joyn iſſue; It is not Chriſts body properly, or naturally: for though it ſignifies a real effect, yet it fignifies the body figuratively, or the effects and real benefits.</p>
               <p>Now concerning this,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> there are very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inducements to infer the figurative or tropical interpretation. 1. In the language which our bleſſed Lord ſpake, there is no word that can expreſſe <hi>ſignificat,</hi> but they uſe the word <hi>Is;</hi> the Hebrews and the Syrians
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:113292:63"/>always joyn the names of the ſigns with the things ſignified; and ſince the very eſſence of a ſign is to ſignifie, it is not an improper elegancy in thoſe languages to uſe <hi>[Eſt]</hi> for <hi>ſignificat.</hi> 2. It is uſual in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
<note place="margin">Gen. 41.26, 27. &amp; 40.12, 18. &amp; 17.10. Exod. 12.11.</note> as may appear, to underſtand <hi>eſt</hi> when the meaning is for the preſent, and not to expreſſe it: but when it ſignifies the future then to expreſſe it; <hi>the ſeven fat cowes, ſeven years; the ſeven withered ears ſhall be ſeven years of famine.</hi> 3 The Greek Interpreters of the Bible ſupply the word <hi>eſt</hi> in the preſent tenſe which is omitted in the Hebrew, as in the places above quoted: but although their Language can very well expreſſe <hi>[ſignifies]</hi> yet they follow the Hebrew Idiom. 4 In the New Teſtament the ſame manner of ſpeaking is retained, to declare that the nature and being of ſigns is to ſignifie they have no other <hi>eſſe</hi> but <hi>ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficare,</hi> and therefore they uſe <hi>eſt</hi> for <hi>ſignificat. The Seed is the Word, the Field is the World, the Reapers are the Angels, the Harveſt is the End of the world; the Rock is Chriſt; I am the Door; I am the Vine, my Father is the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; I am the way, the truth, and the life; Sarah and Agar are the two Teſtaments; the Stars are the Angels of the Churches, the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks are the Churches;</hi> and many more of this kind; we have therefore great and fair,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:113292:63"/>and frequent precedents for expounding this <hi>eſt</hi> by <hi>ſignificat,</hi> for it is the ſtyle of both the Teſtaments to ſpeak in ſigns and repreſentments, where one <hi>diſparate</hi> ſpeaks of another; as it does here: the <hi>body of Chriſt,</hi> of the <hi>bread,</hi> which is the Sacrament; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince the very inſtitution of it is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative, ſignificative,</hi> and <hi>commemorative:</hi> For ſo ſaid our <hi>bleſſed Saviour, Doe this in memorial of me</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And upon this account two other uſual objections (pretending that this being a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> and a <hi>Teſtament,</hi> it ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed without a figure) are diſſolved. For here is a <hi>Covenant</hi> and a <hi>Teſtament</hi> and a <hi>Sacrament</hi> all in one, and yet the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them is figurative; and the being a <hi>Teſtament</hi> is ſo far from ſuppoſing all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in it to be proper and free from fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, that it ſelf, the very word <hi>Teſtament</hi> in the inſtitution of the holy Sacrament is tropical or figurative: <hi>eſt Teſtamentum,</hi> that is, <hi>eſt ſignum Teſtamenti, it is,</hi> that is, <hi>it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies.</hi> And why they ſhould ſay that a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament muſt have in it all plain words and no figures or hard ſayings, that contend that both the Teſtaments New and Old, are very full of hard ſayings, and upon that account
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:113292:64"/>forbid the people to read them, I confeſſe I cannot underſtand. Beſides this, though it be fit in temporal Teſtaments all ſhould be plain, yet we ſee all are not plain; and from thence come ſo many ſuits of Law; yet there is not the ſame reaſon in <hi>ſpiritual</hi> or <hi>divine,</hi> and in <hi>humane</hi> Teſtaments; for in <hi>humane,</hi> there is nothing but legacies and expreſſe commands, both which it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that we underſtand plainly; but in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Teſtaments there are myſteries to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe our induſtry and our faith, our pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and inquiry, ſome things for us to hope, ſome things for us to admire, ſome things to pry into, ſome things to act, ſome things for the preſent, ſome things for the future, ſome things pertaining to this life, ſome things pertaining to the life to come, ſome things we are to ſee in a glaſſe darkly, ſome things reſerved till the viſion of Gods face. And after all this, in humane Teſtaments men ought to ſpeak plainly, becauſe they can ſpeak no more when they are dead. But Chriſt can, for <hi>he being dead, yet ſpeaketh;</hi> and he can by his Spirit make the Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand as much as he pleaſe; and he will as much as is neceſſary: and it might be remembred, that in Scripture there is extant a record of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Teſtament, and of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 49. Deut. 33.</note> which we may obſerve to be an allegory all
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:113292:65"/>the way. I have heard alſo of an <hi>Athenian</hi> that had two ſons, and being asked on his death-bed to which of his two ſons he would give his goods, to <hi>Leon</hi> or <hi>Pantaleon,</hi> which were the names of his two ſons; he only ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> to <hi>Leon,</hi> or to <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon,</hi> is not yet known. And in the Civil Law it is noted that Teſtaments have figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative expreſſions very often; and therefore decreed, <hi>Non n. in cauſâ Teſtamentorum ad definitionem, (ſtrictam, ſive propriam verbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſignificationem,</hi> ſaith the Gloſſe) <hi>utique deſcendendum eſt, cùm plerunque abuſivè lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quantur, nec propriis vocabulis ac nominibus ſemper utantur Teſtatores, l. non aliter</hi> §. <hi>Titi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us F. de legat. &amp; fidei com.</hi> And there are in Law certain meaſures for preſumption of the Teſtators meaning. Theſe therefore are trifling arreſts; even a commandment may be given with a figurative expreſſion, and yet be plain enough: ſuch was that of Jeſus, <hi>Pray ye the Lord of the Harveſt, that he would ſend Labourers into his Harveſt;</hi> and that, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus commanded <hi>his Diſciples to prepare the Paſſeover;</hi> and ſome others: ſo, <hi>Rent your hearts, and not your garments, &amp;c.</hi> And an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of faith may be expreſſed figuratively; ſo is that of Chriſt ſitting at the right hand of his Father. And therefore much more
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:113292:65"/>may there be figurative expreſſions in the inſtitution of a myſterie, and yet be plain enough; <hi>Tropica loquutio cum fit ubi fieri ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, ſine labore ſequitur intellectus;</hi> ſaid S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, l.</hi> 3. <hi>de doct.

               <p n="3">3 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> And indeed there is no poſſibility of diſtinguiſhing ſacramental propoſitions from common and dogmatical, or from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; but that theſe are affirmative of a <hi>nature,</hi> thoſe of a <hi>myſtery;</hi> theſe ſpeak <hi>properly,</hi> they are <hi>figurative:</hi> ſuch as this, <hi>Unleſſe a man be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdome of Heaven.</hi> The propoſition is ſacramental, myſtical,

And yet no man puts out his right eye literally, or cuts off his right hand to prevent a ſcandal.

               <p n="7">7 I argue out of S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> grounds thus:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> As the Fathers did eat Chriſts body,
<note place="margin">Tract. 26. in S. Johan.</note> ſo doe we under a diverſe Sacrament, and different ſymbols, but in all the ſame reality; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we eat, the ſame they did eat; for the difference is this only, they received Chriſt by faith in him that was to come, and we by faith in him that is come already; but
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:113292:69"/>they had the ſame real benefit, Chriſt as really as we, for they had ſalvation as well as we. But the Fathers could not eat Chriſts fleſh in a natural manner, for it was not yet aſſumed: and though it were as good an argument againſt our eating of it naturally, that it is gone from us into heaven; yet that which I now inſiſt upon is, that it was <hi>cibus ſpiritualis</hi> which they eat under the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of <hi>Manna;</hi> therefore we under the Sacrament of bread and wine eating the ſame meat, eat only <hi>Chriſt</hi> in a ſpiritual ſenſe, that is, our ſpiritual meat. And this is alſo true in the other Sacraments of the <hi>Rock</hi> and the <hi>Cloud: Our Fathers eat of the ſame ſpiritual meat, and drank of the ſame ſpiritual drink, that is, Chriſt;</hi> ſo he afterwards expounds it. Now if they did eat and drink Chriſt, that is, were by him in ſacrament and to all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of effect nouriſhed up to life eternal, why cannot the ſame ſpiritual meat doe the ſame thing for us, we receiving it alſo in Sacrament and Myſterie? 2 To which I adde, that all they that doe communicate ſpiritually, doe receive all the bleſſing of the Sacrament, which could not be unleſſe the <hi>myſterie</hi> were only ſacramental, myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſpiritual.

                  <hi>Maldonate</hi> ſpeaking of ſomething of this from the authoritie of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> is of opinion that if S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> were

               <p>Now let it be conſidered whether all that I have ſaid be not abundantly ſufficient to out-weigh their confidence of the literal ſenſe of theſe ſacramental words.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> They find the words ſpoken, they ſay they are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally to be underſtood, they bring nothing conſiderable for it; there is no Scripture that ſo expounds it, there is no reaſon in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the words; but there is all the reaſon of the world againſt it, (as I have and ſhall ſhew) and ſuch, for the meaneſt of which very many other places of Scripture are drawn from the literal ſenſe and reſt in a tropical and ſpiritual. Now in all ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes when we find an inconvenience preſſe the literal expreſſion of a text, inſtantly we find another that is figurative, and why it is not ſo done in this, the intereſt and ſecular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which are conſequent to this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may give ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient account. In the mean time we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not to admit of the literal ſenſe of theſe words, not only by the Analogie of other
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:113292:70"/>ſacramental expreſſions in both Teſtaments, I mean that of Circumciſion and the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over in the Old, and Baptiſm as Chriſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed it to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but alſo 2. becauſe the literal ſenſe of the like words in this very article intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the hereſie of the Capernaites; and 3. becauſe the ſubject and the praedicate in the words of inſtitution are diverſe and diſparate and cannot poſſibly be ſpoken of each other properly. 4 The words in the natural and proper ſenſe ſeem to command an unnatural thing, the eating of fleſh. 5 They ruſh upon infinite impoſſibilities, they contradict ſenſe and reaſon, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and diſcourſes of all mankind, and of all Philoſophie. 6 Our bleſſed Saviour tells us that the fleſh profiteth nothing, and (as themſelves pretend) even in this myſterie, that his words were <hi>ſpirit and life.</hi> 7 The literal ſenſe cannot be explicated by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor by any body for them. 8 It is againſt the Analogie of other Scriptures. 9 It is to no purpoſe. 10 Upon the literal ſenſe of the words, the Church could not confute the

Upon theſe conſiderations, and upon the account of all the particular arguments which I have and ſhall bring againſt it, it is not unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, neither can it ſeem ſo, that we decline the letter, and adhere to the ſpirit, in the ſenſe of theſe words.

               <p n="1">1 If then he gave his natural body,

                  </gap>, his body was delivered broken, his bloud was ſhed: Now thoſe words were ſpoken either <hi>properly and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally;</hi> and then they were not true, becauſe his body was yet whole, his bloud ſtill in the proper channels; or elſe it was ſpoken in a <hi>figurative and ſacramental ſenſe,</hi> and ſo it was true: (as were all the words which our bleſſed Saviour ſpake) for that which he then miniſtred was the Sacrament of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If Chriſt gave his body in the natural ſenſe at the laſt Supper,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> then it was either a ſacrifice propitiatory, or it was not; If it was not, then it is not now, and then their dream of the Maſſe is vaniſhed: if it was propitiatory at the laſt Supper, then God was reconciled to all the world, and mankind
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:113292:72"/>was redeemed before the Paſſion of our bleſſed Saviour: which therefore would have been needleſſe and ineffective: ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are the conſequents of this ſtrange do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> If Chriſt gave his body properly in the laſt Supper, and not only figuratively and in ſacrament, then it could not be a repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſacrament of his Paſſion, but a real exhibition of it: but that it was a Sacrament only, appears by conſidering that it was then alive; that the Paſſion was future, that the thing was really to be performed upon the Croſſe, that then he was to be delivered for the life of the world. In the laſt Supper all this was in type and ſacrament, becauſe it was before, and the ſubſtance was to follow after.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> If the natural body of Chriſt was in the laſt Supper under the accidents of bread, then his body at the ſame time was viſible and inviſible in the whole ſubſtance, viſible in his perſon, inviſible under the accidents of bread: and then it would be inquired what it was which the Apoſtles received, what benefits they could have by receiving the body naturally; or whether it be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable that the Apoſtles underſtood it in the literal ſenſe, when they ſaw his body ſtand by, unbroken, alive, integral, hypoſtatical.</p>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:113292:73"/>then it is, and ſo it cannot be received other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe properly; it unanſwerably followes, that if it be received in any other manner (as it muſt if it be at all) it muſt be received (not naturally or corporally) but <hi>ſpiritually</hi> and <hi>indeed.</hi> By a <hi>figure,</hi> or a <hi>ſacramental, ſpiritual</hi> ſenſe, all theſe difficulties are eaſily aſſoiled, but by the <hi>natural</hi> never.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> At the laſt Supper they eat the bleſſed Euchariſt, but it was not in remembrance of Chriſts death, for it was future then, and therefore not then capable of being remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, any more then a man can be ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what will be done to morrow; it follows from hence that then Chriſt only inſtituted a Sacrament or figurative myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious repreſentment of a thing that in the whole uſe of it was variable by <hi>heri</hi> and <hi>cras,</hi> and therefore never to be naturally verified, but on the Croſſe by a proper and natural preſence, becauſe then it was ſo and never elſe; at that time it was future, and now it is paſt, and in both it is relative to his death; therefore it could not be a real exhibition of his body in a natural ſenſe, for that as it could not be remembred then, ſo neither broken now; that is, nothing of it is natural, but it is wholly ritual, myſterious, and ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. For that this was the ſacrament of his death, appears in the words of Inſtitution,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:113292:73"/>and by the preceptive words, "<hi>Doe this in remembrance of me.</hi> And in the reaſon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined by S. <hi>Paul,</hi>

His body given in the Sacrament is the application and memory of his death and no more; that as Chriſt in heaven repreſents his death in the way of interceſſion, ſo do we by our miniſtrie; but as in heaven it is wholly a repreſenting of his body crucified, a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of his crucifixion, of his death and paſſion, by which he reconciled God and man: ſo it is in the Sacrament after our manner, <hi>This is my body given for you</hi>] that is, <hi>This is the Sacrament of my death, in which my body was given for you.</hi> For as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaid, in all ſciences words ſignifie things, but it is proper to Theologie, that things themſelves ſignified or expreſſed by voices
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:113292:74"/>ſhould alſo ſignifie ſomething beyond it. <hi>This is my body,</hi> are the ſacramental words, or thoſe words by which the myſterie or the thing is ſacramental; it muſt therefore ſignify ſomething beyond theſe words, and ſo they doe; for they ſignifie the death which Chriſt ſuffered in that body. It is but an imperfect conception of the myſterie to ſay it is the Sacrament of Chriſts body only, or his bloud; but it is <hi>ex parte rei,</hi> a Sacrament of the death of his body; and to us a partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, or an exhibition of it, as it became beneficial to us, that is, as it was crucified, as it was our ſacrifice. And this is ſo wholly agreeable to the nature of the thing, and the order of the words, and the body of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that it is next to that which is evident in it ſelf, and needs no further light but the conſidering the words and the deſign of the Inſtitution; eſpecially ſince it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the ſtyle of Scripture in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> and very many other inſtances; it wholly explicates the nature of the myſterie, it reconciles our duty with the ſecret, it is free of all inconvenience, it prejudices no right, nor hinders any real effect it hath or can have; and it makes the myſterie intelligible and prudent, fit to be diſcourſed of, and inſerred into the rituals of a wiſe Religion.</p>

As is our eating ſo is the nouriſhing, becauſe that is in order to this; therefore if you will ſuppoſe that natural eating of Chriſts body does nouriſh ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, yet it muſt alſo nouriſh corporally; let it doe more if it may, but it muſt doe ſo much; juſt as the waters in baptiſm, although the waters are ſymbolical and inſtrumental to the purifying of the ſoul, yet becauſe the waters are material and corporeal, they cleanſe the body firſt and primarily: ſo it muſt be in this Sacrament alſo; if Chriſts body were eaten naturally, it muſt nouriſh naturally, and then paſſe further: but <hi>that which is natural is firſt, and then that which is ſpiritual.</hi>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> In the words of Inſtitution and Conſecration (as they call them) the words
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:113292:77"/>which relate to the conſecrated wine are ſo different in the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, as appears by comparing them together; that 1. It does not appear which words were literally ſpoken by our bleſſed Saviour: for all of them could not be ſo ſpoken as they are ſet down. 2 That they all regarded the ſenſe and meaning of the myſterie, not the letters and the ſyllables. 3. It is not poſſible to be certain that Chriſt intended the words of any one of them to be conſecratory or <hi>effective</hi> of what they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, for every one of the relators differ in the <hi>words</hi> though all agree in the <hi>things;</hi> as the Reader may obſerve in the beginning of the fourth Paragraph, where the four forms are ſet by each other to be compared. 4 The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the conſecration of the Chalice uſes a form of words, which Chriſt ſpake not at all, nor are related by S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> or S. <hi>Mark,</hi> or S. <hi>Luke,</hi> or S. <hi>Paul,</hi> but ſhe puts in ſome things and changes others; her form is this. <hi>Hic eſt enim calix ſanguinis mei novi &amp; aeterni Teſtamenti, myſterium fidei, qui pro vobis &amp; pro multis effundetur in remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionem peccatorum. For this is the chalice of my bloud, of the New and eternal Teſtament, the myſtery of faith, which ſhall be ſhed for you and for many for the remiſsion of ſins:</hi> what is added is plain, what is altered would be
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:113292:78"/>very material, if the words were conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; for they are not ſo likely to be opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and effective as the words of Chriſt recited by S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and S. <hi>Mark,</hi> [this is my bloud:] and if this had not been the ancient form uſed in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> long before the doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was thought of; it is not to be imagined that they would have refuſed the plainer words of Scripture to have made the article more ſecret, the form leſſe operative, the authoritie leſſe warrantable, the words leſſe ſimple and natural. But the corollary which is natural and proper from the particulars of this argument is, that the myſterie was ſo wholly ſpiritual, that it was no matter by what words it were expreſſed, ſo the ſpirit of it were retained; and yet if it had been an hiſtorical, natural, proper ſenſe that had been intended, it ought alſo in all reaſon to have been declared, or (much more) effected by a natural and proper, and conſtant affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative. But that there is nothing ſpoken properly, is therefore evident, becauſe there are ſo many praedications, and all mean the ſame myſterie, <hi>Hic eſt ſanguis meus N. Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti;</hi> and, <hi>Hic calix eſt N. Teſtamentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in meo ſanguine;</hi> and, <hi>Hic eſt calix ſanguinis mei</hi> in the <hi>Roman Miſſal;</hi> all this declares it is <hi>myſterium fidei,</hi> and ſo to be taken in all ſenſes: and thoſe
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:113292:78"/>words are left in their Canon, as if on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe either to prevent the literal and natural underſtanding of the other words, or for the reducing the communicants to the onely apprehenſions of faith: It is <hi>myſterium fidei,</hi> not <hi>ſanguis naturalis,</hi> a myſterie of faith, not natural bloud. For ſuppoſing that both the forms uſed by S. <hi>Matthew</hi> and S. <hi>Luke,</hi> reſpectively could be proper and without a figure;
<note place="margin">L. 1. de Euch. c. 11 § ad terti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am dico.</note> and S. <hi>Matthews Hic eſt ſanguis Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamenti,</hi> did ſignifie, This is the divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe (for ſo <hi>Bellarmine</hi> dreams that <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> there ſignifies) and that in S. <hi>Lukes</hi> words [This cup is the Teſtament] it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>the inſtrument of the Teſtament,</hi> (for ſo a Will or a Teſtament is taken; either for the thing willed or the Parchment in which it is written) yet how are theſe or either of theſe affirmative of the wine being tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated into bloud? it ſayes nothing of that, and ſo if this ſenſe of thoſe words does avoid a trope, it brings in a diſtinct propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if it be ſpoken properly, it is more diſtant from giving authority to their new doctrine; and if the ſame word have ſeveral ſenſes, then in the ſacramental propoſition as it is deſcribed by the ſeveral Evangeliſts, there are ſeveral praedicates, and therefore it is impoſſible that all ſhould be proper. And yet beſides this, although he thinks he may
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:113292:79"/>freely ſay any thing if he covers it with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, yet the very members of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction conclude againſt his concluſion; for if Teſtament in one place be taken for the inſtrument of his Teſtament, it is a tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical loquution; juſt as I ſay, <hi>my bible</hi> (meaning my book) <hi>is the word of God;</hi> that is, contains the word of God, it is a <hi>Metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> of the thing containing for that which it contains.

To this <hi>Bellarmine</hi> weakly anſwers, that theſe words of Chriſt are onely true,
<note place="margin">L. 1. Euch. c. 14. §. Reſp. cum Algero.</note> of that which is taken to nouriſh the body: which ſaying of his is not true; for if it be taken to purge the body, or to make the body ſick, or to make it leane or to miniſter to luſt, or to chaſtiſe the body, as thoſe who in penances have maſticated <hi>aloes</hi> and other bitter gummes, yet ſtill it is caſt into the draught. 2. But ſuppoſe his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true, yet this argument will not ſo be put off; becauſe although the end of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the bleſſed Sacrament, is not to nouriſh
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:113292:82"/>the body; yet that it does nouriſh the body, it affirmed by <hi>Irenaeus, Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
<note place="margin">§. 5. n. 9.</note> of which I have already given ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count To which I here adde the plaine words of <hi>Rabanus, Illud [corpus Chriſti] in nos convertitur dum id manducamus &amp; bibimus. That body is chang'd into us when we eat it and drink it;</hi> and therefore although it hath a higher purpoſe, yet this alſo cannot be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 3. Either we manducate the accidents only, or elſe the ſubſtance of bread, or the ſubſtance of Chriſts body. If we manducate only the accidents,
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. Ariſtot. l. 3. de anim. cap. 12.</note> then how doe we eat Chriſts body? If we manducate bread, then 'tis capable of all the natural alterations, and it cannot be denied. But if we mandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Chriſts body after a natural manner, what worſe thing is it, that it deſcends into the guts, then that it goes into the ſtomach; to be caſt forth, then to be torn in pieces with the teeth, as I have proved
<note place="margin">§. 3. n. 6.</note> that it is by the Roman doctrine? Now I argue thus: if we eat Chriſts natural body, we eat it either <hi>Naturally</hi> or <hi>Spiritually:</hi> if it be eaten only <hi>Spiritually</hi> then it is <hi>Spiritually</hi> digeſted, and is <hi>Spiritual</hi> nouriſhment, and puts on accidents, and affections <hi>Spiritual.</hi> But if the <hi>natural</hi> body be eaten <hi>naturally,</hi> then what hinders it from affections and tranſmutations <hi>natural?</hi> 4. Although <hi>Algerus,</hi> and out of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:113292:83"/>him <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> would have Chriſtians ſtop their ears againſt this argument, (and ſo would I againſt that doctrine of which theſe fearfull concluſions are unavoidable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents) yet it is diſputed in the <hi>Summa An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica,</hi> and an inſtance or caſe put which to my ſenſe ſeems no inconſiderable argument to reprove the folly of this doctrine: For (ſaith he) what if the <hi>Species</hi> paſſe indigeſted into the belly from the ſtomach? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers; that they were not meat if they did not nouriſh; and therefore it is probable as <hi>Boetius</hi> ſaies, that the body of our Lord does not goe into the draught, though the <hi>Species</hi> doe.
<note place="margin">De conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat. diſt. 2. c. Si per negligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam. Gloſ. ibid.</note> And yet it is determined by the <hi>Gloſſe</hi> on the Canon Law, that as long as the <hi>Species</hi> remain uncorrupted, the holy body is there under thoſe <hi>Species;</hi> and therefore may be <hi>vomited;</hi> and conſequently <hi>ejected</hi> all wayes by which the <hi>Species</hi> can paſſe unalter'd. <hi>Eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>úſque progreditur corpus quouſque ſpecies;</hi> ſaid <hi>Harpsfield,</hi> in his diſputation at <hi>Oxford.</hi> If theſe things be put together <hi>viz,</hi> the body is there ſo long as the <hi>Species</hi> are uncorrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and the <hi>Species</hi> may remain uncorrupted till they be caſt upwards or downwards, as in caſe of ſickneſſe: it followes that in this caſe, which is a caſe eaſily contingent, by their doctrine, the holy body muſt paſſe <hi>in latri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam.</hi> And what then? it is to be ador'd as a
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:113292:83"/>true Sacrament though it come from impure places, though it be vomited. So ſaid <hi>Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">in 3. t. 3. d. 195. n. 46.</note> and it is the prevailing opinion in their Church. Adde to this, that if this nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment does not deſcend and cleave to the guts of the Prieſt, it is certain that God does not heare his prayers: for he is enjoyned by the Roman Miſſal publiſhed by authority of the councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the command of <hi>Pope Pius the</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, to pray, <hi>Corpus tuum Domine quod ſumpſi, &amp; ſanguis quem potavi, adhaereat viſceribus meis,</hi> Let thy body O Lord which I have taken, and the bloud which I have drunk, <hi>cleave to my bowels.</hi> It ſeems indeed they would have it goe no further, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the inconveniences of the preſent argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but certain it is that if they intended it for a figurative ſpeech, it was a bold one, and not ſo fitted for edification, as for an objection. But to return. This alſo was the argument of <hi>Origen:
<note place="margin">In cap. 15. S Mat.</note> Quod ſi quicquid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greditur in os, in ventrem abit, &amp; in ſeceſſum ejicitur, &amp; ille cibus qui ſanctificatur per verbum Dei pérque obſecrationem juxta id quod habet materiale in ventrem abit, &amp; in ſeceſſum ejicitur—&amp; haec quidem de typico ſymbolicó<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que corpore.</hi> He plainly diſtinguiſhes the material part from the ſpiritual in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and affirmes that according to the material part, that meat that is ſanctified by
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:113292:84"/>the word of God and prayer, enters into the mouth, deſcends into the belly, and goes forth in the natural ejection. And this is only true of the typical and ſymbolical body. Now beſides that it affirms the words of our bleſſed Saviour
<note place="margin">S. Mat. 15.17.</note> to have effect in the Sacrament, he affirmes that the material part, the type and ſymbols are the body of Chriſt, that is, his body is preſent in a typical and ſymbolical manner. This is the plain and natural ſenſe of the words of <hi>Origen.</hi> But he muſt not mean what he means, if he ſayes any thing in an other place that may make for the Roman opinion. And this is their way of anſwering objections brought from the Fathers; they uſe to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe words to words, and conclude they muſt mean their meaning, or elſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict themſelves. And this trick <hi>Bellarmine</hi> uſes frequently, and eſpecially <hi>Cardinal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> and from them the leſſer Writers: And ſo it happens in this preſent argument: for other words of <hi>Origen</hi> are brought to prove he inclined to the Roman opinion. But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, are the words more contradictory if they be both drawn to a ſpiritual ſenſe, then if they be both drawn to a natural. 2. Though we have no need to make uſe of it, yet it is no impoſſible thing that the Fathers ſhould contradict one another and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:113292:84"/>too; as you may ſee pretended vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently by Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> in his anſwer to K. <hi>James.</hi> 3. But why muſt all ſheavs bow to their ſheaf, and all words be wreſted to their fancy, when there are no words any where pretended from them, but with leſſe wreſting then theſe muſt ſuffer for them, they will be brought by ſpeak againſt them, or at leaſt nothing for them? But let us ſee what other words <hi>Origen</hi> hath, by which we muſt expound theſe. 4. <hi>Origen</hi> ſayes that <hi>the Chriſtian people drinketh the bloud of Chriſt, and the fleſh of the word of God is true food;</hi> What then? ſo ſay we too; but it is <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al food,</hi> and we drink the bloud <hi>Spiritually.</hi> He ſayes nothing againſt that, but very much for it; as I have in ſeveral places re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked already. 5 But how can this expound the other words? Chriſtian people eat Chriſts fleſh and drink his bloud; therefore when <hi>Origen</hi> ſaies <hi>the material part</hi> the <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical body</hi> of Chriſt is eaten naturally and caſt into the draught, he meanes, not the body of Chriſt in his material part, but the accidents of bread, the colour, the taſt, the quantity, theſe are caſt out by the belly. Verily a goodly argument; if a man could gueſſe in what mood and figure it could conclude. 6. When a man ſpeaks diſtinctly and particularly, it is certain he is eaſier to be
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:113292:85"/>underſtood in his particular and minute meaning then when he ſpeaks generally. But here he diſtingniſhes a part from a part, one ſenſe from another, the body in one ſenſe from the body in another, therefore theſe words are to expound the more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and not they to expound theſe, unleſſe the general be more particular then that that is diſtinguiſhed into kinds, that is, unleſſe the general be a particular, and the particular be a general. 7. <hi>Amalarius</hi> was ſo amuſ'd with theſe words and diſcourſe of <hi>Origen</hi> that his underſtanding grew giddy, and he did not know whether the body of Chriſt were inviſibly taken up into heaven or kept till our death in the body,
<note place="margin">Ep. ad Guitard.</note> or expired at let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of bloud, or exhal'd in aire, or ſpit out, or breath'd forth, our Lord ſaying, <hi>That which enters into the mouth, deſcends into the belly, and ſo goes forth into the draught:</hi> The man was willing to be of the new opinion of the real preſence, becauſe it began to be the <hi>mode</hi> of the Age. But his folly was ſoberly repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by a Synod at <hi>Cariſiacum,</hi> about the time of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. where the difficulty of <hi>Origens</hi> argument was better anſwered, and the article determined, that <hi>the bread and wine are ſpiritually made the body of Chriſt, which being a meat of the mind and not of the belly, is not corrupted, but remaineth unto ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:113292:85"/>life.</hi> 8. To expound theſe words of the accidents of bread only, and ſay that they enter into the belly and goe forth in the draught, is a device of them that care not what they ſay; for 1. It makes that the <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject amentum</hi> or excrement of the body ſhould conſiſt of colour and quantity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſubſtance. 2. It makes a man to be nouriſhed by accidents, and ſo not only one ſubſtance to be changed into another, but that accidents are changed into ſubſtances, which muſt be, if they nouriſh the body and paſſe <hi>in latrinam,</hi> and then beyond the device of Tranſubſtantiation we have another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction from <hi>Africa,</hi> a <hi>tranſaccidentiſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. 3. It makes accidents to have all the affections of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as motion, ſubſtantial corruption, alteration, that is, not to be accidents but ſubſtances. For matter and form are <hi>ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and thoſe that integrate all phyſical and compound ſubſtances: but till yeſterday it was never heard that accidents could. Yea but <hi>magnitude</hi> is a <hi>material quality,</hi> and <hi>ground</hi> or <hi>ſubject</hi> of the accidents. So it is ſaid; but it is nonſenſe. For beſides that magnitude is not a <hi>quality,</hi> but a <hi>quantiy,</hi> neither can it be properly or truly ſaid to be <hi>material</hi> but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly; becauſe it is an affection of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and however, it is a contradiction to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:113292:86"/>ſay, that it is the ground of qualities; for an accident cannot be the <hi>fundamentum,</hi> the ground or ſubject of an accident; that is the formality and definition of a ſubſtance, as every young ſcholar hath read in <hi>Ariſtotles Categories:</hi> ſo that to ſay that it is the ground of accidents is to ſay that accidents are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in magnitude, that is, that magnitude is neither a quantity nor quality, but a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. An accident alwaies ſubſiſts in a ſubject, ſaies <hi>Porphyrie.</hi> 9. This anſwer cannot be fitted to the words of <hi>Origen;</hi> for that which he calls the <hi>quid materiale</hi> or the material part in the Sacrament, he calls it <hi>the Symbolical body,</hi> which cannot be affirmed of accidents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no likeneſſe between the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, the colour, the ſhape, the figure, the roundneſſe, the weight, the magnitude of the hoſt, or wafer, and Chriſts body: and therefore to call the accidents a Symbolical body, is to call it an unſymbolical Symbol, un unlike ſimilitude, a repreſentment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out analogy: But if he means the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated bread, the whole action of <hi>conſecration, diſtribution, ſumption, manducation,</hi> this is <hi>the Symbolical body,</hi> according to the words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> He that drinks this cup, and eats this bread, repreſents the Lords death; it is the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Chriſts crucified body, of his paſſion
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:113292:86"/>and our redemption. 10. It is a ſtrange expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to call accidents a body; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſayes <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Categor. cap. 5.</note> a body may be called white, but the <hi>definition</hi> or <hi>reaſon</hi> of the accident, can never be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of a body. I conclude, that this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of the words of our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, urged alſo and affirmed by <hi>Origen,</hi> doe prove that Chriſts body is in the Sacrament only to be eaten in a <hi>Spiritual</hi> ſenſe, not at all in a <hi>Natural,</hi> leſt that conſequent be the event of it; which to affirm of Chriſts glorified body in the natural and proper ſenſe were very blaſphemy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next argument from Scripture is taken from Chriſts departing from this world; his going from us, the aſcenſion of his body and ſoul into heaven; his not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with us, his being contained in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens: So ſaid our bleſſed Saviour,
<note place="margin">S. Ioh. 16.7.14.2. Mat. 26.11. Act. 3.21. Philip 3.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Unleſſe I goe hence, the Comforter cannot come:</hi> and <hi>I goe to prepare a place for you: The poor ye have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, but me ye have not alwayes.</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> affirmes of him <hi>that the heavens muſt receive him, till the time of reſtitution of all things.</hi> Now how theſe things can be true of Chriſt according to his humane nature, that is a circumſcribed body, and a definite ſoul, is the queſtion. And to this the anſwer is the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:113292:87"/>ſame in effect which is given by the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors, and by the <hi>Ubiquitaries,</hi> whom they call <hi>Hereticks.</hi> Theſe men ſay Chriſts humane nature is every where <hi>actually,</hi> by reaſon of his <hi>hypoſtatical union</hi> with the <hi>Deity</hi> which is every where; the Romaniſts ſay no: it is not <hi>actually</hi> every where, but it may be <hi>where,</hi> and is <hi>in as many places</hi> as he pleaſe: for although he be in heaven, yet ſo is God too, and yet God is upon earth: <hi>eodem modo,</hi> ſayes <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 1. Euch. <hi>c.</hi> 14. §. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondeo Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</note> in the ſame manner, the Man Chriſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be in heaven, yet alſo he can be out of heaven, where he pleaſe; he can be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and out of heaven. Now theſe two opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are concentred in the main impoſſibilitie; that is, that Chriſts body can be in more pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces then one: if in two, it may be in 2000, and then it may be every where; for it is not <hi>limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and therefore is <hi>illimited</hi> and <hi>potentially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</hi> Againſt this ſo ſeemingly impoſſible at the veryfirſt ſight, and relying upon a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and analogy that is not far from blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, <hi>viz.</hi> that as God is in heaven and yet on earth, <hi>eodem modo</hi> after the ſame manner is Chriſts body; which words it cannot be eaſie to excuſe: againſt this (I ſay) (although for the reaſons alledged, it be unneceſſary to be diſproved, yet) I have theſe things to oppoſe, 1. The words of Scripture, that affirme Chriſt to be in heaven, affirme alſo
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:113292:87"/>that he <hi>is gone from hence</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">S. Iohn 16.28.</note>. Now if Chriſts body not only could, but muſt be every day in innumerable places on earth, it would have been ſaid that Chriſt <hi>is in heaven,</hi> but not that <hi>he is not here,</hi> or that he is gone from hence. 2. <hi>Surrexit, non eſt hîc,</hi> was the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels diſcourſe to the inquiring woman at the Sepulchre, <hi>he is riſen, he is not here:</hi> but if they had been taught the new doctrine of the Roman Schooles, they would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the conſequent; <hi>he is riſen and gone from hence,</hi> but he may be here too. And this indeed might have put the Angels to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction: but the womens ignorance ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them ſecure. However S.

                  <hi>Auſtin</hi> is dogmatical in this article, ſaying, <hi>Chriſtum ubique totum eſſe tanquam Deum &amp; in eodem tanquam inhabitante Deum, &amp; in loco aliquo caeli propter veri corporis modum.</hi> Chriſt as God is every where, but in reſpect of his body he is determin'd to a particular reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> at the right hand of God, that is in the beſt ſeat, and in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt eminency. And in 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Treatiſe of S. <hi>Iohn, It behoveth that the body of our Lord ſince it is raiſed again ſhould be in one place alone, but the truth is ſpread over all.</hi> But concerning theſe words of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> they have taken a courſe in all their editions to corrupt the place; And in ſtead of <hi>[oportet]</hi> have clap'd

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:113292:89"/>could be the interpretation of thoſe words, then they did not at all ſignifie Chriſts leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this world, but onely his changing his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of fortune, his outward dreſſe and appendages of perſon; which were a ſtrange commentary upon <hi>[me ye have not alwayes;]</hi> that is, I ſhall be with you ſtill, but in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condition; but S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath given ſentence concerning the ſence of theſe words of Chriſt <hi>[loquebatur de praeſentiâ corporis &amp;c.]
<note place="margin">Tract. 50. in Johan.</note> he ſpake of the preſence of his body, ye ſhall have me according to my providence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Majeſty, and inviſible grace, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh which the word aſſumed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which was born of the Virgin Mary, ye ſhall not have me, therefore becauſe he converſed with his diſciples fourty dayes he is aſcended up into heaven and is not here;</hi> If he be here in perſon, what need he to have ſent his Vicar, his holy Spirit in ſubſtitution? eſpecially ſince by this doctrine he is more now with his Church then he was in the days of his converſation in <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> for then he was but in one aſſembly at once; now he is in thouſands every day. If it be ſaid, becauſe although he be here yet we ſee him not. This is not ſufficient, for what matter is it whether we ſee him or no, if we know him to be here, if we feel him, if we eat him, if we worſhip him in preſence natural and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:113292:89"/>proper? There wants nothing but ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of colour and ſhape. A friend in the dark, behind a curtain, or to a blind man, is as certainly preſent as if he were in the light in open converſation, or beheld with the eyes. And then alſo the office of the holy Spirit would only be to ſupply the ſight of his perſon, which might poſſibly be true if he had no greater offices, and we no greater needs, and if he himſelf alſo were viſible and glorious to our eyes; for if the effect of his ſubſtitution is ſpiritual, ſecret, and inviſible, our eyes are ſtill without comfort; and if the Spirits ſecret effect does ſupply it and makes it not neceſſary that we ſhould ſee him, then ſo does our faith doe the ſame thing; for if we believe him there, the want of bodily ſight is ſupplied by the eye of faith, and the Spirit is pretended to doe no more in this particular, and then his preſence alſo will be leſſe neceſſary, becauſe ſupplied by our own act. Adde to this; That if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſts aſcenſion into heaven, he ſtill would have been upon earth, in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, and received properly into our mouths, and in all that manner which theſe men dream; how ready it had been and eaſie to have comforted them who were troubled for want of his bodily preſence; by telling them [Although I goe to heaven yet fear
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:113292:90"/>not to be deprived of the preſence of my body, for you ſhall have it more then before, and much better; for I will be with you, and in you; I was with you in a ſtate of humility and mortality, now I will be with you with a daily and mighty miracle; I before gave you promiſes of grace and glory, but now I will become to your bodies a ſeed of immortality. And though you will not ſee me, but under a vail, yet it is certain, I will be there, in your churches, in your pixes, in your mouths, in your ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs, and you ſhall believe and worſhip.] Had not this been a certain, cleare, and proportionable comfort to their complaint, and preſent neceſſity, if any ſuch thing were intended? It had been ſo certain, ſo cleare, ſo proportionable, that it is more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that if it had been true, it had not been omitted. But that ſuch ſacred things as theſe may not be expoſed to contempt, by ſuch weak propoſitions and their trifling conſequents, the caſe is plain, that Chriſt being to depart hence ſent his holy Spirit in ſubſtitution to ſupply to his church the office of a <hi>Teacher,</hi> which he on earth in perſon was to his diſciples; when he went from hence, he was to come no more in perſon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſent his ſubſtitute; and therefore to pretend him to be here in perſon though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

Shall we now ſay, our eyes are deceived, our eares hear a falſe ſound, our taſt is abuſed, our hands are miſtaken?
<note place="margin">Bellarm. l. 1. Euch. c. 14. §.

For ſo <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he ſaw an Angel in the ſhape of a humane body, was not deceived in the ſhape of a man, for there was ſuch a ſhape; but yet it
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:113292:92"/>was not a man, and therefore if he thought it was, he was abuſed;</q> This is their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: and if this will not ſerve the turne, nothing will; This therefore muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.</p>
               <p>Now this,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> inſtead of taking away the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable difficulty, does much increaſe it, and confeſſes the thing which it ought to have avoided. For 1. the accidents proper to a ſubſtance are for the manifeſtation, and notice of the ſubſtance, not of themſelves, for as the man feels, but the means by which he feels is the ſenſitive faculty, ſo that which is felt is the ſubſtance, and the meanes by which it is felt is the accidents: as the ſhape, the colour, the bigneſſe, the motion of a man, are manifeſtative, and declarative of a humane ſubſtance: and if they repreſent a wrong ſubſtance, then the ſenſe is deceived by a falſe ſigne of a true ſubſtance, or a true ſigne of a falſe ſubſtance: as if an Alchymiſt ſhould ſhew me braſſe color'd like gold, and made ponderous, and ſo adulterated that it would endure the touchſtone for a long while, the deception is, becauſe there is a pretence of improper accidents; <hi>true acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents indeed,</hi> but not belonging to that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. But 2. it is true that is pretended, that it is not ſo much the outward ſenſe that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, as the inward; that is, not ſo much the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:113292:93"/>
                  <hi>eye,</hi> as the <hi>Man;</hi> not the <hi>ſight,</hi> but the <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> and this is it we complain of. For indeed, in proper ſpeaking, the eye, or the hand is not capable of being deceived; but the man by the eye, or by the ear, or by his hand. The eye ſees a colour, or a figure, and the inward ſenſe apprehends it, to be the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of ſuch a ſubſtance, and the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judges it to be the thing which is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented by the accident: <hi>it is ſo, or it is not ſo: if it be,</hi> there is no deception; <hi>if it be not ſo,</hi> then there is a couſenage: there is no lie till it comes to a propoſition either expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, or implicit; a lie is not in the ſenſes; but when a man by the miniſtery of the ſenſes is led into the apprehenſion of a wrong object, or the belief of a falſe propoſition: then he is made <hi>to believe a lie:</hi> and this is our caſe, when accidents proper to one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance are made the cover of another, to which they are not naturally communicable. And in the caſe of the holy Sacrament, the matter, if it were as is pretended, were into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable. For in the caſes wherein a man is commonly deceived, it is his own fault by paſſing judgement too ſoon; as if he ſhould judge glaſſe to be Cryſtal, becauſe it looks like it; This is not any deception in the ſenſes, nor any injury to the man; becauſe he ought to conſider more things then the colour to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:113292:93"/>make his judgement whether it be glaſſe, or Cryſtal, or diamond, or ice; the hardneſs, the weight, and other things are to be ingredients in the ſentence. And if any two things had all the ſame accidents, then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſenſes were not deceived, yet the man would certainly and inculpably miſtake. If therefore in the Euchariſt (as is pretended) all the accidents of bread re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, then all men muſt neceſſarily be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; If only one or two did remain, one ſenſe would help the other, and all together would rightly inform the underſtanding. But when all the accidents remain, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but repreſent that ſubſtance to which thoſe accidents are proper; and then the holy Sacrament would be a conſtant, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable deception of all the world, in that which all mens notices are moſt evident and moſt relied upon, I mean their ſenſes. And then the queſtion will not be, whether our ſenſes can be deceived or no. But whether or no it can ſtand with the juſtice and goodneſſe of God to be angry with us for believing our ſenſes, ſince himſelf hath ſo ordered it that we cannot avoid being deceived? there being in this caſe as much reaſon to believe a lie, as to believe a truth, if things were ſo as they pretend. The reſult of which is this: That as no one ſenſe can be deceived about
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:113292:94"/>his proper object; but that a man may, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſubſtance lying under thoſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which are the object proper to that ſenſe, becauſe he gives ſentence according to that repreſentment otherwiſe then he ought, and he ought to have conſidered other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents proper to other ſenſes, in making the judgment; as the birds that took the picture of grapes for very grapes; and he that took the picture of a curtain for a very curtain, and deſired the painter to draw it aſide; they made judgement of the grapes and the curtain, only by colour and figure, but ought to have conſidered the weight, the taſt, the touch, and the ſmell: ſo on the other ſide, if all the ſenſes concur, then not only is it true that the ſenſes cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived about that object which is their own, but neither ought the man to be deceived about that ſubſtance which lies under thoſe accidents; becauſe their miniſtery is all that natural inſtrument of conveying notice to a mans underſtanding which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. 4. Iuſt upon this account it is, that S. <hi>Johns</hi> argument had been juſt nothing in behalf of the whole religion: for that God was incarnate, that Jeſus Chriſt did ſuch miracles, that he was crucified, that he roſe again and aſcended into heaven, that he preached theſe ſermons, that he gave ſuch
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:113292:94"/>commandements, he was made to believe by ſounds, by ſhapes, by figures, by motions, by likeneſſes, and appearances of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per accidents: and his ſenſes could not be deceived about the accidents which were the proper objects of the ſenſes; but if they might be deceived about the ſubſtance under theſe accidents, of what truth or ſubſtance could he be aſcertain'd by their miniſtery? for he indeed ſaw the ſhape of a humane body; but it might ſo be, that not the body of a man, but an Angelical ſubſtance might lie under it; and ſo the article of the aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of humane nature is made uncertain. And upon the ſame account ſo are all the other articles of our faith which relyed upon the verity of his body and nature: all which if they are not ſufficiently ſignified by their proper accidents, could not be ever the more believed for being ſeen with the eyes, and heard with the eares, and handled with our hands; but if they were ſufficiently declared by their proper accidents, then the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding can no more be deceived in the ſubſtances lying under the accidents, then the ſenſes can in the accidents themſelves.</p>
               <p>To the ſame purpoſe it was that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were anſwered concerning the article of the truth of Chriſts reſurrection.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> For when the Apoſtles were affrighted at his ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

To this I reply, 1. That ſuppoſe it were true what he ſaid; yet it would alſo follow by his own words. <hi>This is ſeen-bread,</hi> and <hi>is handled,</hi> ſo therefore <hi>it is
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:113292:95"/>bread. Hoc enim affirmativè colligitur.</hi> This is the affirmative conſequent made by our bleſſed Lord, and here confeſſed to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.

Now then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it cannot be both in the proper and natural ſenſe, but one of them muſt be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative and tropical; ſince both of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellatives are equally affirm'd, is it not noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious that in this caſe we ought to give judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on that ſide which we are prompted to by common ſenſe? If Chriſt had ſaid only, This is my body, and no Apoſtle had told us alſo that it is bread; we had reaſon to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect our ſenſes to be deceived, if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they ſhould be: but when it is equally affirmed to be bread, as to be our Lords bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and but one of them can be naturally true and in the letter, ſhall the teſtimony of all our ſenſes be abſolutely of no uſe in caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ballance? The two affirmatives are equal; one muſt be expounded tropically, which will you chuſe? Is there in the world any thing more certain and expedite then that what you ſee, and feel, and taſt natural
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:113292:96"/>and proper, ſhould be judged to be that which you ſee, and feel, and taſt naturally and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and therefore that the other be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded tropically? ſince you muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound one of the words tropically, I think it is not hard to determine whether you ought to doe it againſt your ſenſe, or with it. But it is alſo remarkable that our bleſſed Lord did not only by feeling and ſeeing prove it to be a body: but by proving it was <hi>his body,</hi> he proved it was <hi>himſelf;</hi> that is, by theſe accidents repreſenting my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ye are not led into an errour of the perſon, any more then of the kind of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; <hi>See my hands and my feet,</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> I ſhall lay this prejudice in the article as relating to the diſcourſes of reaſon; that in the words of inſtitution there is nothing that can be pretended to prove the converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>the ſubſtance of bread</hi> into <hi>the body of Chriſt,</hi> but the ſame will infer the converſion
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:113292:106"/>of <hi>the whole</hi> into <hi>the whole;</hi> and therefore of the <hi>accidents of the bread</hi> into the <hi>accidents of the body.</hi> And in thoſe little pretences of Philoſophy which theſe men ſometimes make to couſen fools into a belief of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, they pretend to no inſtance, but to ſuch converſions in which if the ſubſtance is changed, ſo alſo are the accidents: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the accident is chang'd in the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſubſtance; but if the ſubſtance be changed, the accidents never remain the ſame individually; or in kind, unleſſe they be ſymbolical, that is, are common to both, as in the change of elements, of aire into fire, of water into earth. Thus when Chriſt changed water into wine, the ſubſtances being chang'd, the accidents alſo were alter'd, and the wine did not retain the colour and taſt of water; for then though it had been the ſtranger miracle, that wine ſhould be wine, and yet look and taſt like water, yet it would have obtained but little advantage to his doctrine and perſon, if he ſhould have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to prove his miſſion by ſuch a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. For if Chriſt had ſaid to the gueſts; To prove that I am come from God, I will change this water into wine; well might this prove his miſſion: but if while the gueſts were wondring at this, he ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed and ſay, wonder ye not at this, for I
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:113292:107"/>will do a ſtranger thing then it, for this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall be changed into wine, and yet I will ſo order it, that it ſhall look like water, and taſt like it, ſo that you ſhall not know one from the other: Certainly this would have made the whole matter very ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; and indeed it is a ſtrange device of theſe men to ſuppoſe God to work ſo many prodigious miracles as muſt be in <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,</hi> if it were at all, and yet that none of theſe ſhould be ſeen; for to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is a miracle that cannot be perceived? It can prove nothing, nor do any thing, when it ſelf is not known whether it be or no. When bread is turned into fleſh, and wine into bloud in the nouriſhment of our bodies (which I have ſeen urg'd for the credibility of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi>) The bread as it changes his nature, changes his accidents too, and is fleſh in colour, and ſhape, and dimenſions, and weight, and operation, as well as it is in ſubſtance. Now let them rub their foreheads hard and tell us, it is ſo in the holy Sacrament. For if it be not ſo, then no inſtance of the change of Natural ſubſtances from one form to another can be pertinent: for 1. though it be no more then is done in every operation of a body, yet it is alwayes with change of their proper acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; and then 2. It can with no force of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:113292:107"/>the words of the inſtitution be pretended, that one ought to be or can be without the other. For he that ſayes this is the body of a man, ſayes that it hath the ſubſtance of a humane body, and all his conſequents, that is, the accidents; and he that ſayes this is the body of <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſayes (beſides the ſubſtance) that it hath all the <hi>individuating conditions,</hi> which are the particular accidents; and therefore Chriſt affirming this to be his body, did as much affirm the change of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents as the change of ſubſtance: becauſe that change is naturally and eſſentially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to this. Now if they ſay they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not believe the accidents of bread to be changed, becauſe they ſee them remain; I might reply, <hi>Why will they believe their ſenſe againſt faith?</hi> ſince <hi>there</hi> may be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but <hi>here</hi> is certainty, and it cannot be deceived though our <hi>eyes</hi> can: and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that Chriſt affirm'd it without diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one part from another, of ſubſtance from his uſual accidents. <hi>This is my body. Hoc, Hîc, Nunc,</hi> and <hi>Sic.</hi> Now if they think their eyes may be credited for all the words of our bleſſed Saviour, why ſhall not their reaſon alſo? or is nothing ſo certain to the underſtanding, as any thing is to the eye? If therefore it be unreaſonable to ſay that the accidents of bread are chang'd againſt our
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:113292:108"/>ſenſe, ſo it will be unreaſonable to ſay, that the ſubſtance is chang'd againſt our reaſon; Not but that God can, and does often change one ſubſtance into another, and it is done in every natural production of a ſubſtantial form; but that we ſay it is unreaſonable that this ſhould be chang'd into fleſh (not to fleſh ſimply, for ſo it is when we eat it, nor into Chriſts fleſh ſimply, for ſo it might have been, if he had, as it is probable he did, eaten the Sacrament himſelf, But) into that body of Chriſt which is in heaven he remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning there, and being whole and <hi>impaſsible,</hi> and <hi>unfrangible,</hi> this we ſay is unreaſonable and <hi>impoſſible:</hi> and that's now to be proved.</p>

Now in matters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, although to ſhew a thing to be thus <hi>impoſſible</hi> is not enough to prove it was not at all, if God ſaid it was; for although to man it be impoſſible, yet to God all things are poſſible; yet when the queſtion is of the ſenſe of the words of Scripture which are capable of various interpretations, he that brings an argument <hi>ab impoſſibili</hi> againſt any one interpretation, ſhewing that it infers ſuch an ordinary impoſſibility as cannot be

Thus when in Scripture we find it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded that Chriſt was born of a Virgin, to ſay this is impoſſible is no argument againſt it, becauſe although it be <hi>naturally impoſſible</hi> (which I think is demonſtrable againſt the <hi>Arabian Phyſitians</hi>) yet to him that ſaid it, it is alſo poſſible to do it. But then if from hence any man ſhall obtrude as an article of faith, that the bleſſed Virgin Mother was ſo a Virgin that her <hi>holy Son</hi> came into the world without any aperture of his mothers womb, I doubt not but an argument <hi>ab impoſſibili</hi> is a ſufficient conviction of the falſhood of it; though this impoſſibility be only an <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>natural;</hi> becauſe the words of Scripture affirming Chriſt to be <hi>born of a virgin,</hi> ſay only that he was not begotten by natural ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; not that his egreſſion from his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb made a <hi>Penetration of dimenſions.</hi> To inſtance once more: The words of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture are plain, That <hi>Chriſt is man,</hi> That <hi>Chriſt is God;</hi> Here are <hi>two natures</hi> and yet but <hi>one Chriſt;</hi> No impoſſibility ought to be pretended againſt theſe plain words, but they muſt be ſophiſmes, becauſe they diſpute againſt truth it ſelf. But now if a <hi>Monothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite</hi>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:113292:109"/>ſhall ſay that by this unity of nature, God hath taught an unity of wills in Chriſt, and that he had but one will, becauſe he is but one perſon; I do not doubt but an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from an ordinary and natural impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility will be ſufficient to convince him of his hereſie; and in this caſe the <hi>Monothelite</hi> hath no reaſon to ſay that the orthodox Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian denyes Gods omnipotency, and ſayes that God cannot unite the will of Chriſts hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity to the will of his Divinity. And this is true in every thing which is not declared minutely, and in his particular ſenſe. There is ordinarily no greater argument in the world, and none better is commonly uſed, nor any better required, then to reduce the opinion to an impoſſibility; for if this be not true without a miracle, you muſt prove your extraordinary, and demonſtrate your miracle; which will be found to be a new impoſſibility.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> but that in the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation there are a great many impoſſibilities, which are ſuch <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>ordinarily;</hi> but by divine power they can be done; but that they are done they have no warrant, but the plain literal ſenſe of the words of <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum:</hi> Now this is ſo far from proving that God does work perpetual miracles to verifie their ſenſe of it, that the working of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles ought to prove that to be the ſenſe of it. Now the probation of a propoſition by miracles, is an open thing, clear as thunder, and being a matter of ſenſe, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:113292:111"/>more known then the thing which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to prove, ought not to be proved by that which is the thing in queſtion. And therefore to ſay that God will work a miracle rather then his words ſhould be falſe, is certain but impertinent: For concerning the words themſelves there is no queſtion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now, no more need of miracles to confirm them; concerning the meaning of them is the queſtion; They ſay this is the meaning. <hi>Queſt.</hi> How do you prove it ſince there are ſo many impoſſibilities in it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and ordinarily? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Becauſe God ſaid it, therefore it is true: <hi>Reſp.</hi> Yea, that God ſaid the words we doubt not, but that <hi>his words</hi> are to be underſtood in <hi>your ſenſe,</hi> that I doubt; becauſe if I believe your ſenſe I muſt admit many things ordinarily impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yea, but nothing is impoſſible to God. <hi>Reſp.</hi> True, nothing that <hi>can be done,</hi> exceeds his power; but ſuppoſing this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely poſſible, yet how does it appear that God <hi>will do</hi> a miracle to verifie <hi>your ſenſe,</hi> which otherwiſe cannot be true; when with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a miracle the words may be true in <hi>many other</hi> ſenſes? <hi>I am dic Poſthume:</hi> for it is hard that men by a continual effort and violence ſhould maintain a propoſition againſt reaſon and his unqueſtionable maximes, thinking it ſufficient to oppoſe againſt it Gods om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency;
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:113292:111"/>as if the crying out a miracle, were a ſufficient guard againſt all abſurdity in the world: as if the wiſdom of God did arm his power againſt his truth, and that it were a fineneſſe of Spirit to be able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the two parts of a contradiction; and all upon confidence of a miracle which they cannot prove. And indeed it were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtrange, that thouſands and thouſands of times, every day for above 1500 years together, the ſame thing ſhould be done, and yet this ſhould be called a miracle, that is, <hi>a daily extraordinary;</hi> for by this time it would paſſe into nature and a rule, and ſo become a ſupernatural natural event, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traregular rule, an extraordinary ordinary, a perpetual wonder, that is, a wonder and no wonder: and therefore I may infer the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per corollaries of this argument, in the words of <hi>Scotus,</hi> whoſe opinion it was pity it could be overborn by tyranny. 1.

It cannot be
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:113292:112"/>told why bread ſhould be choſen for the ſymbol of the body, but becauſe of his nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing faculty, and that the accidents ſhould nouriſh without ſubſtance, is like feeding a man with muſick, and quenching his thirſt with a Diagram. 2. It is <hi>fantaſtical</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical</hi> bread not <hi>natural,</hi> which by the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the table, and therefore unfit to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh or to typifie that which can. 3. <hi>Painted bread</hi> might as well <hi>be ſymbolical</hi> as the <hi>real,</hi> if the <hi>real bread</hi> become no bread: for then that which remains is nothing but the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, as colour and dimenſions &amp;c.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> But then becauſe we are ſpeaking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:113292:112"/>what may be done by God, it ought to be conſider'd that it is raſh and impudent to ſay that the body of Chriſt cannot by the power of God (who can do all things) be really in the Sacrament without the natural converſion of bread into him. <hi>God can make that the body of Chriſt ſhould be</hi> de novo <hi>in the Sacrament of the altar, without any change of it ſelf, and without the change of any thing into it ſelf, yet ſome change being made about the bread, or ſomething elſe.</hi> They are the words of <hi>Durand</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Sent. 4. diſt. 11. q. 1.</note>.

               <p>But now concerning impoſſibilities,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> if it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute can be evinc'd that this doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation does affirm <hi>contradictions,</hi> then it is not only an intolerable prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the doctrine, as is the ordinary and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>impoſſibility;</hi> but it will be abſolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be true, and it derogates from God to affirm ſuch a propoſition in religion, and much more to adopt it into the body of faith. And therefore when S. <hi>Paul</hi> had quoted
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:113292:113"/>that place of Scripture; <hi>He hath put all things under him;</hi> he adds, <hi>It is evident, that he is excepted who did put all things under him;</hi> for if this had not been ſo underſtood, then he ſhould have been under himſelf, and he that gave the power ſhould be leſſen'd, and be inferiour to him that received it; which becauſe they infer impoſſibilities, like thoſe which are conſequent to <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes no more of it but to ſay, <hi>The contrary is manifeſt</hi> againſt the unlimited literal ſenſe of the words.

               <p>The doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the nature and eſſence of a body.
<note place="margin">Lib. 3. Euch. c. 2. §. ult.</note> 
                  <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> ſeems afraid of this; for, immediately before, he goes about to prevaricate about <hi>the being of a body in many places at once,</hi> he ſayes, that if the eſſence of things were evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and particularly known, then we might know what does, and what does not
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:113292:113"/>imply a contradiction; but, <hi>id non ſatis conſtat,</hi> there is no certainty of that; by that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended uncertainty making way as he hopes to eſcape from all the preſſure of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions that lye upon the prodigious philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy of this Article: But we ſhall make a ſhift ſo far to underſtand the eſſence of a body, as to evince this doctrine to be full of contradictions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For Chriſts body,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> his <hi>Natural body</hi> is changed into a <hi>Spiritual body,</hi> and it is not now a <hi>Natural body</hi> but a <hi>Spiritual;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be now in the Sacrament after a <hi>natural manner,</hi> becauſe it is ſo <hi>no where,</hi> and therefore not there; <hi>It is ſown a natural body, it is raiſed a Spiritual body.</hi> And therefore though this Spirituality be not a change of one ſubſtance into another, yet it is ſo a change of the ſame ſubſtance, that it hath loſt all thoſe accidents which were not <hi>perfective</hi> nor <hi>conſtitutive,</hi> but imperfect and ſeparable from the body; and therefore in no ſenſe of nature can it be manducated. And here is the firſt contradiction. The body of Chriſt is in the Sacrament. The ſame body is in heaven. In heaven it cannot be broken naturally; In the Sacrament they ſay it is broken <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>properly;</hi> therefore <hi>the ſame body is and is not, it can and it cannot be broken.</hi> To this they anſwer, that it is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:113292:114"/>under the <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>bread; Not in it ſelf;</hi> Well! is it broken or is it not broken? let it be broken under what it will, if it be broken, the thing is granted. For if by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken under the <hi>Species,</hi> it be meant that the <hi>Species</hi> be broken alone, and not the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, then they take away in one hand what they reach forth with the other. This being a better argument, <hi>The Species only are broken, the Species are not Chriſts body, therefore Chriſts body is not broken:</hi> better I ſay then this, <hi>The body of Chriſt is under the Species, the Species alone are broken, therefore the body of Chriſt is broken.</hi> For how can the breaking of <hi>Species</hi> or accidents, infer the breaking of Chriſts body, unleſſe the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents be Chriſts body, or inſeparable from it? or rather, How can the breaking of the accidents infer the breaking of Chriſts body when it cannot be broken? To this I deſire a clear and intelligible anſwer. Adde to this, how can <hi>Species,</hi> that is, <hi>accidents,</hi> be broken, but when a ſubſtance is broken? for an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent properly, ſuch as ſmel, colour, taſt, hath of it ſelf no <hi>ſolid,</hi> and <hi>conſiſtent,</hi> nor indeed any <hi>fluid parts,</hi> nothing whereby it can be broken, and have a part divided from a part; but as the ſubſtance in which the accident is ſubjected becomes divided, ſo doe the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent accidents; but no otherwiſe: and if this
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:113292:114"/>cannot be admitted, men cannot know what one another ſay or mean, they can have no notices of things or regular propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But I demand,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> When we ſpeak of a body, what we mean by it?

For if it
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:113292:115"/>could be there and be in another place, it were two and not one. A finite Spirit can be but in one place, but it is there without circumſcription; that is, it hath no parts meaſured by the parts of a place, but is there after another manner then a body, that is, it is in every part of his definition or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual location. So it is ſaid, a ſoul is in the whole body; not that a part of it is in the hand, and a part of it in the eye, but it is whole in the whole, and whole in every part; and it is true that it is ſo, if it be wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material: becauſe that which is ſpiritual and immaterial, cannot have material parts. But when we ſpeak of a <hi>body,</hi> all the world means that, which hath a <hi>finite</hi> quantity, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd to <hi>one place.</hi> This was the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy of all the world, taught in all the ſchools of the Chriſtians and Heathens, even of all mankind, till the doctrine of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation was to be nurs'd and maintain'd, and even after it was born, it could not be forgotten by them who were bound to keep it. And I appeal to any man of the Roman perſuaſion, if they can ſhew me any ancient Philoſopher, Greek, or Roman, or Chriſtian of any Nation, who did not believe it to be eſſential to the <hi>being of a body to be in one place:</hi>

And how is it poſſible that Chriſts body ſhould be in heaven, and between it and us are many other bodies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed, and his body is in none of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedials, and that his body ſhould be alſo here, and yet not joyned to that, either by <hi>continuity</hi> or <hi>contiguity,</hi> and the ſame body ſhould be a thouſand miles off, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand bodies between them, and yet all this be but one: that is, How can it be two and yet be one? For how ſhall any man reckon two? How can he know that two glaſſes of wine are not one? We ſee them in two places, their continuity divided, there is an interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial diſtance and other bodyes interpoſed, and therefore we ſilly men uſually ſay they are two; but it is ſtrange to ſee, a man may
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:113292:121"/>be conſident and yet without reaſon when he hath not wit enough to tell two. But then there is not in nature any way for a man to tell two, if this principle be taken from us.</p>
               <p>It will alſo be an infinite, impoſſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction which followes the being of a body in two places at once; upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. For it will infer that the ſame body is at the ſame time, in the ſame reſpect, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the ſame place, both actually and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially, that is, poſſeſſed and not poſſeſſed of it, and may go to that place where it is already.

               <p>Adde to this, that to be in two places at once, makes the ſame thing which is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in diverſe places to be contain'd in none. For as to be in a place like a body, is to be contain'd in that place; ſo to be contain'd in
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:113292:122"/>that place is to be terminated or bounded by that place; but whatſoever is bounded by a thing, is not without or beyond that bounds; it followes therefore that if a body can be intirely without or beyond that place in which it is contained, that is without the bounds, then it is bounded and not bounded, it is contained and not contained; that is, it is contained by diverſe, and it is contained by none.</p>
               <p>But how can any thing be divided from it ſelf wholly?

If one body may poſſeſſe and fill two places circumſcriptively, that it is commenſurate to both of them, or to as many more as it ſhall chance to be in, then ſuppoſe a body of five foot long, is in a place at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Valladolid,</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> and at <hi>London,</hi> in each of theſe places it muſt fill a ſpace of five foot long, becauſe it is alwayes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate to his place: it will follow, that a body but of five foot long ſhall fill up the room of twenty foot; which whether it implies not a contradiction that the ſame body ſhould be but five foot long, and yet at
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:113292:123"/>the ſame time be twenty foot long of the ſame meaſure, let all the Geometricians judge. This is ſuch a device, that as one ſaid of the witty drunkenneſſe and arts of the <hi>Sympoſiac</hi> among the Greeks, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them a dunce could not be drunk: So in this device a man had need be very cunning to ſpeak ſuch nonſenſe, and make himſelf believe thoſe things which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the conceptions of all men in the world, till this <hi>new doctrine</hi> turned their brains and make <hi>new propoſitions</hi> and new af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatives out of <hi>old impoſſibilities.</hi> But theſe people in all this affaire, deal with mankind, as if they were beaſts, and not reaſonable creatures; or as if all their diſciples were babies, or fooles, and that to them it is lawful to ſay any thing, and having no underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their own, they are to efform them as they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>But to this objection it is anſwer'd,

That which can be in many places, can be in all places; for all the reaſon that forbids it to be in 2000 forbids it to be in two; and if <hi>thoſe</hi> cannot determine it to one place, it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd at all; I mean, <hi>the nature of a body, his determination to places, his circumſcription, continuity, unity, quantity, dimenſions.</hi> Nay, that which is not determin'd by place, by continuity nor by his nature, but may be any where, is in his own nature uncircumſcrib'd,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:113292:125"/>and <hi>indefinite,</hi> which is that attribute of God upon which his omnipreſence does rely; and that Chriſts body is not every where actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as is the holy Ghoſt, it ſayes nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this; becauſe he being a voluntary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent can reſtrain the meaſure of his preſence, as God himſelf does the many manners of his preſence. However, that nature is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite that can be every where, and therefore if it can be communicated to a body, to be ſo, is not proper to God, nor can it prove the holy Ghoſt ſo to be. Of the ſame nature is that other argument uſed frequently by the primitive Doctors, proving two natures to be in Chriſt, the Divine and the Humane, and the difference between them is remarked in this, that the Divine is <hi>in many places,</hi> and <hi>in all:</hi> but the <hi>Humane</hi> can be but in one at once.

               <p>Againſt all this,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> and whatſoever elſe can be objected, it is pretended, that it is poſſible for a body to be in many diſtant places at once. For Chriſt who is alwayes in heaven, yet appeared to S. <hi>Paul</hi> on earth, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:113292:125"/>other Saints, as to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> to S. <hi>Antony,</hi> to S. <hi>Tharſilla,</hi> S. <hi>Gregory</hi> and I cannot tell who. To this I anſwer; 1. That in all this there is nothing certain, but that Chriſt appeared to S. <hi>Paul;</hi> for it may be, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him in heaven, S. <hi>Paul</hi> being on earth: for ſo he did to S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Acts of the Apoſtles:
<note place="margin">Acts 7.55.</note> and from heaven there might only come a voice and a light. 2. It may be S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw Chriſt when he was wrapt up into <hi>the third heavens:</hi> for, that Chriſt was ſeen by him, himſelf affirmes; but he ſayes not that he ſaw him at his converſion; and all that he ſayes he ſaw then, was that <hi>he ſaw a great light and heard a voice.</hi> 3. That, in caſe Chriſt did appear corporally to <hi>Saul</hi> on earth,
<note place="margin">Acts 9.3.22.6.</note> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes not, his body was in two places at once. I have the warrant of him that is willing enough otherwiſe that this argument ſhould prevail:
<note place="margin">Bellar. de Euch. l. 3. c. 3. §. Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matur.</note> 
                  <hi>Quia non eſt improbabile Chriſtum pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatìm &amp; ad breve tempus deſcendiſſe de coelopoſt aſcenſionem.</hi> It is not unlikely that Chriſt might privately and for a ſhort time deſcend from heaven after his aſcenſion; For when it is ſaid in Scripture that <hi>the heavens muſt receive him till the day of reſtitution of all things,</hi> it is to be meant, <hi>ordinarily</hi> and as his place of reſidence; but that hinders not an extraordinary commigration; as a man
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:113292:126"/>may be ſaid to dwell continually in <hi>London,</hi> and yet ſometimes to goe into the country to take the aire. For the other inſtances of S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Antony,</hi> and the reſt, if I were ſure they were true. I would ſay the ſame anſwer would alſo ſerve their turn; but as they are, it is not material whether it does or no.</p>
               <p>Another way of anſwering is taken from the examples of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>reaſonable ſoul.</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> Concerning the ſoul, I have theſe things to ſay; 1. Whether the ſoul be whole in every part of the body and whole in the whole is preſum'd by moſt men, but ſubſtantially proved by none, but denyed by a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and thoſe of the firſt rank of learned men. 2. If it were, it followes not that it is in two places or more: becauſe not the hand nor the foot is the adequate place of the ſoul, but the whole body; and therefore the uſual expreſſion of Philoſophy, ſaying, <hi>The ſoul is whole in every part</hi> is not true <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> but <hi>negatively,</hi> that is, the ſoul being immaterial, cannot be cantoniz'd into parts by the diviſion of the body; but <hi>poſitively</hi> it is not true. For the <hi>underſtanding</hi> is not in the foot, nor the <hi>will</hi> in the hand; and ſomething of the ſoul is not <hi>arganical</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the body: <hi>viz. The pure acts of volition,</hi> ſome <hi>little glimpſes of intuition,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:113292:126"/>reflexion,</hi> and the like. 3. If it were, yet to allege this, is impertinent to their purpoſe: unleſs whatſoever is true concerning a ſpirit, can alſo be affirmed of a body. 4. When the body is divided into parts, the ſoul is not multiplied into fantaſtick or real numbers, as it is pretended in Tranſubſtantiation; and therefore, although the foul were <hi>whole in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part</hi> it could do no ſervice in this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; unleſſe it were ſo whole in each part as to be whole when each part is divided, for ſo it is ſaid to be in the Euchriſt; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſay is impoſſible, we require an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in ſomething where it is ſo; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not ſo in the ſoul, this inſtance is not home to any of their purpoſes.

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:113292:127"/>as uncertain as the principal queſtion, cannot give faith to it, or do any ſervice. But this is to amuſe unwary perſons, by ſeeming to ſay ſomething, which indeed is nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But that the <hi>Omnipreſence of God</hi> ſhould be brought to prove it poſſible that a body may be in many places,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> truly though I am hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſirous to do it, if I could juſtly, yet I cannot find any colour to excuſe it from great impiety. But this I ſhall adde, that it is ſo impoſſible that any body ſhould be in two places, and ſo impoſſible to juſtifie this from the immenſity of God; that God himſelf, is not in proper manner of ſpeaking in two places, he is not capable of being in any place at all, as we underſtand being in a place; he is greater then all places, and fills all things: and <hi>locality,</hi> and <hi>place;</hi> and <hi>beings,</hi> and <hi>relations</hi> are all from him: and therefore they cannot comprehend him. But then although this immenſity of God is beyond the capacity of place, and he can no more be in a place, then all the world can be in the bottome of a well, yet if God could be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and determin'd, it were a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſay that he could be in two places; juſt as it is a contradiction to ſay there are two Gods. So that this compariſon of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines,</hi> as it is odious up to the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:113292:127"/>and ſimilitude of a great impiety, ſo it is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, it is againſt that Philoſophy whereby we underſtand any of the perfective notices of God. But theſe men would fain prevail by all means, they care not how.</p>
               <p>But why may we not believe as well the doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> in defiance of all the ſeeming impoſſibilities,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> as well as we believe the doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of greater? To this I anſwer many things. 1. Becauſe the myſterie of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> is revealed plainly in Scripture, but the doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is againſt it: as I ſuppoſe my ſelf to have plainly proved. So that if there were a plain revelation of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> then this argument were good; and if it were poſſible for 10000 times more arguments to be brought againſt it, yet we are to believe the revelation in deſpite of them all; but when ſo much of revelation is againſt it, and nothing for it, it is but vain to ſay we may believe this, as well as the doctrine of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> for ſo we may as well argue for the hereſie of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees;</hi> why may we not as well believe the doctrine of the <hi>Manichees</hi> in deſpite of all the arguments brought againſt it; when there are ſo many ſeeming impoſſibilities brought againſt the <hi>holy Trinity?</hi> I ſuppoſe
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:113292:128"/>the anſwer that I have given, would be thought reaſonable to every ſuch pretence. 2. As the doctrine of the <hi>holy Trinity</hi> is ſet down in Scripture, and in the Apoſtles Creed and was taught by the Fathers of the firſt 300 years, I know no difficulties it hath; what it hath met withall ſince, proceeds from the too curious handling of that which we cannot underſtand. 3. The School-men have ſo pried into this ſecret, and have ſo confounded themſelves and the articles, that they have made it to be unintelligible, inexplicable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defenſible in all their minuits and particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities; and it is too ſadly apparent in the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Antitrinitarians,</hi> whoſe <hi>ſophiſms</hi> againſt the article it ſelf, although they are moſt eaſily anſwered, yet as they bring them againſt the <hi>minutiae</hi> and impertinences of the ſchool, they are not ſo eaſily to be avoided. But. 4. there is not the ſame reaſon; becauſe concerning God we know but very few things, and concerning the <hi>myſterious Trinity</hi> that which is revealed is extremely little; and it is general, without deſcending to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: and the difficulty of the ſeeming arguments againſt that, being taken from our Philoſophy, and the common manner of ſpeaking, cannot be apportion'd and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſo great a ſecret; neither can that at all be meaſur'd by any thing here below.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:113292:128"/>But I hope we may have leave to ſay we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand more concerning <hi>bodies;</hi> and <hi>their nature</hi> then concerning the perſons of the holy Trinity: and therefore we may be <hi>ſure</hi> in the matter of <hi>bodies</hi> to know what is, and what is not poſſible; when we can know no meaſure of truth or errour in all the myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſes of ſo high and ſeparate, ſuperexalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſecret, as is that of the holy Trinity. 5. Becauſe when the Church for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this ſecret of the holy Trinity hath taken words from Metaphyſical learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as <hi>perſon, hypoſtaſts, conſubſtantiality,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and ſuch like, the words of themſelves were apt to change their ſignification, and to put on the ſenſe of the preſent ſchool. But the Church was forc'd to uſe ſuch words as ſhe had, the higheſt, the neereſt, the moſt ſeparate and myſterious. But when ſhe ſtill kept theſe words to the ſame myſterie, the words ſwell'd or alter'd in their ſenſe; and were exacted according to what they did ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie amongſt men in their low notices; this begat difficulty in the doctrine of the holy Trinity. For better words ſhe had none, and all that which they did ſignifie in our Philoſophy could not be applied to this myſterie, and therefore we have found diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; and ſhall for ever, till in this article the Church returns to her ancient ſimplicity
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:113292:129"/>of expreſſion. For theſe reaſons I conceive the caſe is wholly different, and the difficulty and ſecret of one myſtery, which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly revealed, cannot warrant us to admit the impoſſibilities of that which is not revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Let it appear that God hath affirm'd <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and I for my part will burn all my arguments againſt it, and make publick amends. The like alſo is to be ſaid in the matter of Incarnation.</p>

To which adde this; that if <hi>Epicurus</hi> his opinion were true, and that there were ſome ſpaces empty, which at leaſt by a divine power can become true, and he can take the aire out from the incloſure of four walls; In this caſe if you will ſuppoſe a man ſitting in the midſt of that room, either that man were in no place at all, which were infinitely abſurd, or elſe (which indeed is true) circumſcription or ſuperficies were not the eſſence of a place. Place therefore is nothing but the <hi>Space</hi> to which quantitative bodies have eſſential <hi>relation</hi> and <hi>finition:</hi> that, where they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and by which they are not infinite: and this is the definition of <hi>place</hi> which S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> gives in his fourth book Expoſit. of <hi>Geneſ. ad literam</hi> chapt. 8.</p>

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:113292:131"/>can be changed, the things remaining the ſame? that is, whether they can be the ſame, when they are not the ſame?

                  <hi>John</hi> mentioned the ſhutting the doores in relation to the Apoſtles fear; not to Chriſts entring: he intended not (ſo far as appears) to declare a miracle. 7.

               <p>I find but one objection more pretended,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> and that is, that place is not eſſential to bodies: becauſe the utmoſt heaven is a body, and yet is not in a place; becauſe it hath nothing without it, that can circumſcribe it. To this I have already anſwered in the confutation of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> definition of a place. But beſides;
<note place="margin">Num. 28.</note> I anſwer, that what the utmoſt heaven is, our Philoſophy cannot tell or gueſſe at; But it is certain that beyond any thing that Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy ever dreamed of, there are bodies. For <hi>Chriſt is aſcended for above all heavens,</hi>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:113292:134"/>and therefore to ſay it is not in a place, or that there is not a place where Chriſts body is, is a ridiculous abſurdity. But if there be places for bodies above the higheſt heavens, then the higheſt heaven alſo is in a place, or may be for ought any thing pretended againſt it. <hi>In my Fathers houſe are many man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> ſaid <hi>Chriſt, many places of abode;</hi> and it is highly-probable, that that pavement where the bodies of Saints ſhall tread to eternal ages, is circumſcribed, though by ſomething we underſtand not.

               <p>The ſum is this;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> as ſubſtances cannot ſubſiſt without the manner of ſubſtances;

And four may as well ceaſe to be four and be reduced to unity, as a line ceaſe to be a line, and a body a body, and a place a place, and a <hi>quantum</hi> or <hi>exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum</hi> to be extended in his own kind of quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity or extenſion: and if a man had talked otherwiſe, till this new device aroſe, all ſects

               <p n="10">10. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> By this doctrine of Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the ſame thing is bigger and leſſe then it ſelf: for it is bigger in one <hi>hoſt,</hi> then in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for the <hi>wafer</hi> is Chriſts body, and yet one <hi>wafer</hi> is bigger then another: therefore Chriſts body is bigger then it ſelf. The ſame thing is above it ſelf, and below it ſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ſelf, and without it ſelf: It ſtands whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon his own right ſide, and wholly at the ſame time upon his own left ſide; it is as very a body as that which is moſt diviſible, and yet it is as indiviſible as a Spirit; and it is not a Spirit but a body, and yet a body is no way ſeparated from a Spirit, but by being diviſible. It is a perfect body, in which the feet are further from the head, then the head from the breaſt, and yet there is no ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween head and feet at all; So that the parts are further off and neerer, without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:113292:135"/>at all; being further and not further, diſtant, and yet in every point. By this alſo, here is <hi>magnitude</hi> without extenſion of parts; for if it be <hi>eſſential</hi> to <hi>magnitude</hi> to have <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem extra partem,</hi> that is, parts diſtinguiſhed, and ſeverally ſited, then where one part is, there another is not, and therefore the whole body of Chriſt is not in every part of the conſecrated wafer; and yet if it be not, then it muſt be broken into parts when the wafer is broken, and then it muſt fill his place by parts. But then it will not be poſſible that a bigger body, with the conditions of a body ſhould be contain'd in a thing leſs then it ſelf, that a man may throw the houſe out at the windowes: and if it be impoſſible that a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude ſhould be in a point, and yet Chriſts body be a magnitude and yet in a point, then the ſame thing is in a point, and not in a point, extended and not extended, great and not diviſible, a quantity without dimenſion, ſomething and nothing.* By this doctrine the ſame thing lies ſtill and yet moves, it ſtayes in a place and goes away from it, it removes from it ſelf, and yet abides cloſe by it ſelf, and in it ſelf, and out of it ſelf; It is remov'd and yet cannot be moved, broken and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be divided; * paſſes from Eaſt to Weſt thorough a midle place, and yet ſtirs not. * It is brought from heaven to earth, and yet

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:113292:144"/>they meant the change of ſubſtance into ſubſtance, properly by <hi>converſion,</hi> then they have confuted the preſent doctrine of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation;</hi> which though they call a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial change, yet an accident is the <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus mutationis,</hi> that is, it is by their explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, wholly an accidental change, as I have before diſcourſed; for nothing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced but <hi>Ubiquity</hi> or <hi>Preſentiality,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vide §. 11. n. 34.</note> that is, it is only made preſent where it was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And it is to be obſerved, that there is a vaſt difference between <hi>Converſion,</hi> and <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> the firſt is not denied; meaning by it a change of uſe, of condition, of ſanctification; as a Table is changed into an Altar; a Houſe, into a Church; a Man, into a Prieſt; <hi>Matthias,</hi> into an Apoſtle; the Water of the River, into the Laver of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; but this is not any thing of Tranſubſtantiation. For in this new device, there are three ſtrange affirmatives, of which the Fathers never dream't. 1. That the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural being of bread is wholly ceaſed, and is not at all, neither the matter nor the form. 2. That the accidents of bread and wine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main without a ſubject, their proper ſubject being annihilated, and they not ſubjected in the holy body. 3. That the body of Chriſt is brought into the place of the bread, which is not chang'd into it, but is ſucceeded by it.
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:113292:144"/>Theſe are the conſtituent propoſitions of Tranſubſtantiation, without the proof of which, all the affirmations of converſion ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothing to their purpoſe, or againſt ours.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> When the Fathers uſe the word <hi>Nature</hi> in this queſtion, ſometimes ſaying the <hi>Nature is changed,</hi> ſometimes that <hi>the Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,</hi> it is evident that they either contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted each other, or that the word <hi>Nature</hi> hath amongſt them diverſe ſignifications. Now in order to this, I ſuppoſe, if men will be determined by the reaſonableneſſe of the things themſelves, and the uſual manners of ſpeech, and not by prejudices, and prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, it will be evident, that when they ſpeak of the change of <hi>Nature,</hi> ſaying that bread changes his nature, it may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of an accidental change: for that the word <hi>Nature</hi> is uſed for a change of accidents, is by the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors contended for, when it is to ſerve their turns, (particularly in their anſwer to the words of Pope <hi>Gelaſius:</hi>) and it is evident in the thing; for we ſay, a man of <hi>a good nature,</hi> that is, of a loving diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is <hi>natural</hi> to me to love, or hate, this, or that; and <hi>it is againſt my nature,</hi> that is, my cuſtome, or my affection. But then, as it may ſignifie accidents, and a <hi>Natural change,</hi> may yet be <hi>accidental,</hi> as when water is chang'd into ice, wine into vineger; yet it is alſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:113292:145"/>that <hi>Nature</hi> may mean <hi>ſubſtance:</hi> and if it can by the analogy of the place or the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of ſpeach, or by any thing be declared, when it is that they mean a <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> by uſing the word, <hi>nature;</hi> it muſt be certain, that then, <hi>ſubſtance</hi> is meant, when the word <hi>nature</hi> is uſed diſtinctly, from, and in oppoſition to accidents: or when it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated by and in conjunction with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; which obſervation is reducible to practiſe, in the following teſtimonies of <hi>Theodoret, Gelaſius</hi> and others; <hi>Immortalita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem dedit,

To which I adde this, that the heathens ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Chriſtians to be worſhippers of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> or <hi>Liber,</hi> becauſe of the holy bread and chalice (as appears in S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> 20 book and 13 chapter againſt <hi>Fauſtus</hi> the Manichee) had reaſon to advance the reputation of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental ſignes to be above common bread and wine, not only ſo to explicate the truth of the myſterie, but to ſtop the mouth of their calumny: and therefore for higher ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions there might be cauſe, but not ſuch cauſe for any lower then the ſevereſt truth; and yet let me obſerve this by the way: S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> anſwered only thus: <hi>We are far from doing ſo, Quamvis panis &amp; calicis Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ritu noſtro amplectamur.</hi> S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> might have further removed the calumny, if he had been of the Roman perſwaſion; who

But he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that. Neither was there ever any ſcandal of Chriſtians upon any miſtake that could be a probable excuſe for them to leſſen their expreſſions in the matter Euchariſtical. Indeed M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Brerely</hi> hath got an ignorant fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy by the end, which I am now to note, and wipe off. He ſayes that the Primitive Chriſtians were ſcandalized by the Heathen to be eaters of the fleſh of a child, which in all reaſon muſt be occaſion'd by their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the manducation of Chriſts fleſh in the Sacrament; and if this be true, then we may ſuſpect that they to wipe off this ſcandal might remove their doctrine as far from the objection as they could, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might uſe ſome leſſening expreſſions. To this I anſwer, that the occaſions of the report were the ſects of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> and the <hi>Peputians.</hi> The <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> reports, bruiſed a new born infant in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and all of them did communicate by eating portions of it; and the <hi>Montaniſts</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſprinkled a little child with meal let him bloud, and of that made their <hi>Euchariſtical bread;</hi> and theſe ſtoryes the Jewes publiſhed to diſrepute, if they could, the whole reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; but nothing of this related to the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:113292:149"/>doctrine of the Chriſtian <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> though the bell alwayes muſt tinkle as they are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to think. But this turn'd to advantage of the truth, and to the clearing of this article. For when the ſcandal got foot, and run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, the Heathens ſpared not to call the Chriſtians <hi>Cannibals,</hi> and to impute to them anthropophagy, or the devouring humane fleſh, and that they made <hi>Thyeſtes</hi> Feaſt, who by the procurement of <hi>Atreus</hi> eat his own children. Againſt this the Chriſtian <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſts</hi> betook themſelves to a defence. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſayes the falſe devils had ſet on work ſome vile perſons, to kill ſome one or other, to give colour to the report.

But <hi>Blandina</hi> anſwered them thus: <hi>How can they ſuffer any ſuch thing in the exerciſe of their Religion, who doe not nouriſh themſelves with fleſh that is permitted?</hi> All this trouble came upon the act of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd hereticks; the report was only concerning the bloud of an infant, not of a man, as it muſt have been if it had been oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd by the Sacrament; but the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not ſo much as thought of in this ſcrutiny, till the examination of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants gave the hint in the torture of <hi>Blandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.

For this would have been a worſe, and more intolerable ſcandal, to affirm that Chriſtians eat their God, and ſucked his bloud, and were devourers not only of a man, but of an immortal God. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever let his fancy be confronted with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts of the ſeveral apologies which I have now cited, and it will appear, that nothing of the <hi>Cardinals</hi> fancy can come neer their ſenſe, or words: for all the buſineſſe was upon the bloud of a child which the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> had kild, or the <hi>Montaniſts</hi> tormented; and the matter of the Sacrament, was not in the whole rumour ſo much as thought upon.</p>

<note place="margin">In 3.

                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:113292:153"/>though, I ſay, they denyed Chriſt to have a body. Now becauſe this uſage of theirs did confute their grand hereſie, (for to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhould they celebrate the Sacrament of Chriſts body, if he had none?) therefore it is that S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> might ſay: They did not admit the Euchariſt, becauſe they did not confeſſe it to be the fleſh of Chriſt: for though in practiſe they did admit it, yet in theory they denyed it, becauſe it could be nothing, as they handled the matter. For how could it be Chriſts fleſh Sacramentally, if he had no fleſh really? And therefore they did not admit the Euchchariſt, as the Church did, for in no ſenſe would they grant it to be the fleſh of Chriſt; not the figure, not the Sacrament of it; leſt admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the figure they ſhould alſo confeſſe the ſubſtance: But beſides, if theſe words had been againſt us, it had ſignified nothing; becauſe theſe words are not in S. <hi>Ignatius;</hi> they are in no Greek copy of him; but they are reported by <hi>Theodoret.</hi> But in theſe there is nothing elſe material, then what I have accounted: for I only took them in by the by, becauſe they are <hi>great names,</hi> and are objected ſometimes.</p>

To this I reply, 1. It muſt mean, this which is preſent is my body, not this figure of my body which was in the old Teſtament, but this which we mean in the words of conſecration; and then it is no <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbaton,</hi> which is to be ſupplyed with <hi>quod
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:113292:154"/>erat; This, which was;</hi> for the nature of a <hi>hyperbaton</hi> is, to make all right, by a meer tranſpoſition of the words; as, <hi>Chriſtus mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuus eſt,</hi> i. e. <hi>unctus;</hi> place <hi>unctus</hi> before <hi>mortuus</hi> and the ſentence is perfect; but it is not ſo here: without the addition of two words, it cannot be; and if two words may be added, we may make what ſenſe we pleaſe. But 2. ſuppoſe that <hi>figura corporis</hi> does refer to <hi>Hoc,</hi> yet it is to be remembred that <hi>Hoc,</hi> in that place, is one of the words of the inſtitution, or conſecration, and then it can have no ſenſe to evacuate the preſſure of his words. 3. Suppoſe this reference of the words to be intended, then the ſenſe will be; <hi>This figure of my body, is my body,</hi> the conſequent of which, is that which we contend for: that the ſame which is called <hi>his body, is the figure of his body:</hi> the one is, the ſubject; the other, the predicate: and then it affirms all that is pleaded for: as if we ſay: <hi>Haec effigies eſt homo,</hi> we mean it is the <hi>effigies</hi> of a man; and ſo in this, <hi>This fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of my body, is my body,</hi> by the rule of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominatives, ſignifies, <hi>This is the figure of my body.</hi> 4.

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:113292:155"/>ſe concupiſcentiâ concupiſſe edere paſcha ut ſuum (indignum enim ut quid alienum concupiſceret Deus)</hi> he would eat the Paſſeover of his own, <hi>figuram ſanguinis ſui ſalutaris im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plere concupiſcebat,</hi> he deſir'd to fulfil the figure, that is, to produce the laſt of all the figures of his healing bloud: Now this was by eating the Paſchal lamb, that is, himſelf; for the other was not to be eaten that night. Now then if the eating, or delivering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be eaten that night, was <hi>implere figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram ſanguinis ſui,</hi> he then did fulfil the figure of his bloud, therefore <hi>figura corporis mei</hi> in the following words, muſt relate to what he did that night; that therefore was the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, but the more excellent, becauſe the neereſt to the ſubſtance, which was given really the next day: this therefore as S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nazianzen</hi> affirms was the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent figure, the Paſchal lamb it ſelf being <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gura figurae,</hi> the figure of a figure, as I have quoted him in the ſequel.

Whereas it is added, it had not been a figure <hi>niſi veritatis eſſet corpus,</hi> to my ſenſe clears the queſtion; for therefore Chriſts body, which he was cloth'd withal, was a true body, elſe this could not be a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of it; But therefore this which was alſo a figure, could not be the true body, of which it was a figure. 6. That which <hi>Fiſher</hi> adds, that <hi>Tertullians</hi> drift was to ſhew, that whereas, in the old Teſtament, bread was the figure of the body of Chriſt (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the words of the Prophet, <hi>Mittamus lignum in panem ejus,</hi> i. e. <hi>crucem in corpus ejus</hi>) Chriſt in the new Teſtament made this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure really to be his body; This I conceive to make very much againſt <hi>Tertullians</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne. For he proves that therefore Chriſt might well call bread his body; that was no new thing, for it was ſo alſo in the old figure; and therefore may be ſo now: but that this was no more then a figure, he adds, <hi>If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he made bread to be his body, becauſe he wanted a true body, then bread was delivered for us; and it would advance the vanity of</hi> Marci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>that bread was crucified.</hi> No, this could not be; but therefore he muſt mean, that as of old in the Prophet and in the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, ſo now in the laſt ſupper, he gave the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:113292:156"/>ſame figure, and therefore that which was figured was real, <hi>viz.</hi> his crucified body. Now ſuppoſe we ſhould frame this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of <hi>Tertullians medium,</hi> and ſuppoſe it to be made by <hi>Marcion.</hi> The body of Chriſt, was delivered for the ſins of the world, &amp;c. you Catholicks ſay that bread is the body of Chriſt, therefore you ſay, that bread was <hi>delivered for the ſins of the whole world, and that bread was crucified for you, and that bread is the ſon of God;</hi> what anſwer could be made to this out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> but by expounding the minor propoſition <hi>figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively?</hi> we Catholicks ſay that the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtical bread, is the body of Chriſt in a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative ſenſe, it is <hi>completio</hi> or <hi>conſummatio figurarum,</hi> the laſt and moſt excellent of all figures. But if he ſhould have ſaid accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Roman fancy, that it is the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral body of Chriſt, it would have made rare triumphs in the Schools of <hi>Marcion.</hi> But that there may be no doubt in this particular, hear himſelf ſumming up his own diſcourſes in this <hi>queſtion.

<note place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 19.</note> for ſpeaking of the ſame figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſpeech of the prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> and why bread ſhould be called his body; he gives this account: <hi>Hoc lignum &amp; Ieremias tibi inſinuat dicturis praedicans Iudaeis, Venite mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamus lignum in panem ejus, utique in corpus; fic enim Deus in Evangelio quoque veſtro re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velavit, panem corpus ſuum appellans, ut &amp; hinc jam eum intelligas corporis ſui figuram pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni dediſſe, cujus retro corpus in panem prophetes figuravit ipſo Domino hoc Sacramentum poſtea interpretaturo. For ſo God revealed in your Goſpel, calling bread his body, that hence thou mayeſt underſtand that he gave to bread the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of his body, whoſe body anciently the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet figured by bread, afterwards the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf expounding the Sacrament.</hi> Nothing needs to be plainer.

But upon this account nothing can be proved from ſayings of Fathers. For either they are not their own works but made by another, or 2. They are capable of another ſenſe, or 3. The places are corrupted by hereticks, or 4. It is not in ſome old copies; which pretences I am content to let alone, if they upon this account will but tranſact the queſtion whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Scripture and common ſenſe. 5. It matters not at all what he is, ſo he was not eſteemed a heretick; and that he was not, it is certain, ſince by themſelves theſe books are put among the works of S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and themſelves can quote them when they ſeem to do them ſervice.

But however this new queſtion began to brand the words of Type and Antitype,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:113292:166"/>and the manner of ſpeaking began to be changed, yet the article as yet was not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.

So <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (as I remember) But this is
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:113292:167"/>juſt as if I ſhould ſay that I ought to refuſe the <hi>Lateran Councel</hi> becauſe they were <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of Images,</hi> or defenders of Purgatory. Surely if I ſhould, I had much more reaſon to refuſe their ſentence, then there is that the Greeks ſhould be rejected upon ſo ſlight a pretence; nay for doing that which for ought appears was in all their circumſtances their duty in a high meaſure: ſo that in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect they are refuſed for being good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. But after this, it happened again that the words of <hi>type</hi> and <hi>image</hi> were diſliked in the queſtion of the holy Sacrament, by the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the great, his Tutor <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuinus,</hi> and the aſſembly at <hi>Franckfort;</hi> but it was in oppoſition to the Councel of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> that called it the true image of Chriſts body, and of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councel who decreed the worſhip of images; for if the Sacrament were an image, as they of CP. ſaid, then it might be lawful to give reverence and worſhip to ſome images; for although theſe two Synods were enemies to each other, yet the propoſition of one, might ſerve the deſigne of the other; but therefore the Weſtern doctors of that age, ſpeaking againſt the decree of this, did alſo miſlike the expreſſion of that: meaning that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not a type or image, as a type is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a prefiguration, a ſhadow of things
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:113292:167"/>to come, like the legal ceremonies, but in oppoſition to that is a body, and a truth; yet ſtill it is a Sacrament of the body, a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie which is the ſame in effect with that which the Fathers taught in their ſo frequent uſing theſe words of Type &amp;c. for 750 years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And concerning this I only note the words of <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour <hi>Ep. ad Alcuinum</hi> after the Synod, Our Lord hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the bread and the chalice <hi>in figurâ corporis ſui &amp; ſui ſanguinis,</hi> in the figure of his body and bloud. But ſetting the authority aſide, for if theſe men of CP. be not allowed, yet the others are, and it is notorious that the Greek Fathers did frequently call the bread and wine <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the Latin Fathers call them ſignes, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes, figures, types, images, therefore there muſt be ſomething pretended to ſtop this great outcry, and inſupportable preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of ſo great, ſo clear authority. After many tryals; as that by <hi>antitypes</hi> they mean <hi>exemplars,</hi> that it is only before conſecration, not after, and ſuch other little devices, of which they themſelves quickly grew weary; at laſt the craftieſt of them came to this, that the body of Chriſt under the <hi>Species</hi> might well be ſaid to be the ſigne of the ſame body and bloud, as it was on the croſſe;

<note place="margin">Dial. 1. c. 8.</note> Chriſt honored the ſymbols and ſignes which are ſeen with the title of his body and bloud, not changing the nature, but to nature adding grace.</hi> The words are not capable of an anſwer if we obſerve that he ſayes there is no change made, but only grace ſuperadded; in all things elſe the things are the ſame.

If he had anſwered thus, how had <hi>Theodoret</hi> confuted the <hi>Eutychians?</hi> For thus ſayes <hi>Eraniſtes, As the bread is changed in ſubſtance into the body of Chriſt, ſo is the humanity into the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity:</hi> yea but, ſayes <hi>Theodoret</hi> according to <hi>Bellarmine; The ſubſtance of bread is not changed; for the colour, the ſhape, the bigneſſe and the ſmell remain:</hi> or thus, <hi>the accidents remain which I call ſubſtance; for there are two ſorts of ſubſtances; ſubſtances</hi> and <hi>accidents;</hi> and this latter ſort of <hi>ſubſtances</hi> remain; but not the former; and ſo you are confuted, <hi>Eraniſtes.</hi> But what if <hi>Eraniſtes</hi> ſhould reply, if you ſay <hi>all of bread is changed</hi> excepting the accidents, then my argument holds: for I only contend that the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is changed, as you ſay the ſubſtance of bread is: To this nothing can be ſaid, unleſſe <hi>Theodoret</hi> may have leave to anſwer as other wiſe men muſt. But now <hi>Theodoret</hi> anſwer'd, that the ſubſtance of bread is not chang'd, but remains ſtill, and by ſubſtance, he did mean ſubſtance, and not the accidents; for if he had, he had not ſpoken ſenſe.

He diſtinguiſhes ſubſtance from form and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and therefore by ſubſtance cannot mean form and figure, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> dreams. 6 He affirms concerning the body of Chriſt, that in the reſurrection it is changed in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, being made <hi>incorruptible</hi> and <hi>immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> but affirms that the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> remains; therefore by ſubſtance, he muſt mean as he ſpeaks without any prodigious ſenſe affixed to the word. 7. Let me obſerve this by the way, that the doctrine of the ſubſtantial change of bread into the body of Chriſt was the perſwaſion of the heretick, <hi>the Eutychian Eraniſtes,</hi> but denied by the <hi>Catholick Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret;</hi> So that if they will pretend to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in this doctrine, their plea is made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and framed by the <hi>Eutychian,</hi> from whom they may, if they pleaſe, derive the original of their doctrine, or if they pleaſe, from the elder <hi>Marcoſites;</hi> but it will be but vain to think the <hi>Eutychian</hi> did argue from thence, as if it had been a Catholick ground; reaſon we might have had to ſuppoſe it, if the Catholick had not denied it. But the caſe is plain: as the Sadduces diſputed with Chriſt about the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of <hi>no Spirits, no reſurrection,</hi> though in
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:113292:171"/>the Church of the Jewes the contrary was the more prevailing opinion: ſo did the <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians</hi> upon a pretence of a <hi>Subſtantial conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> in the Sacrament, which was then their fancy, and deviſed to illuſtrate their other opinion: But it was diſavowed by the Catholicks.</p>

But ſuppoſe he was not Pope, that he was a Catholick biſhop is not denied; and that he lived above a 1000 years agoe; which is all I require in this buſineſſe. For any other biſhop may ſpeak truth, as well as the biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> and his truth ſhall be of equal intereſt and perſwaſion.

               <p>WHen a propoſition goes no further then the head and the tongue, it can carry nothing with it but his own appenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>viz.</hi> to be right or to be wrong, and the man to be deceived or not deceived in his judgement: But when it hath influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on practice, it puts on a new inveſtiture, and is tolerable or intolerable, according as it leads to actions good or bad. Now in all the queſtions of Chriſtendome nothing is of greater effect or more material event, then this. For ſince by the decree of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Trent</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Seſſ. 13. c. 5.</note>, they are bound to exhibit <hi>to the Sacrament</hi> the ſame worſhip which they give to the true God, either this Sacrament is <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> or elſe they are very Idolaters; I mean <hi>materially ſuch</hi> even while in their purpoſes they decline it. I will not quarrel with the words of the decree commanding to give divine worſhip to the Sacrament;
<note place="margin">

<pb n="334" facs="tcp:113292:176"/>that which I inſiſt upon, is this. That if they be deceived in this difficult queſtion, againſt which there lie ſuch infinite preſumptions and evidence of ſenſe, and invincible reaſon, and grounds of Scripture, * and in which they are condemned by the primitive Church, * and by the common principles of all Philoſophy, and the nature of things, * and the analogy of the Sacrament, * for which they had no warrant ever, till they made one of their own, * which themſelves ſo little underſtand, that they know not how to explicateit, * nor agree in their own mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor cannot tell well what they mean * If I ſay, they be deceived in their own ſtrict ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, beſides the ſtrict ſenſe of which there are ſo many wayes of verifying the words of Chriſt, upon which all ſides do rely; then it is certain they commit an act of Idolatry in giving divine honour to a meer creature, which is the image, the Sacrament, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentment of the body of Chriſt: and at leaſt, it is <hi>not certain</hi> that they are right; there are certainly very great probabilities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them which ought to abate their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the article; and though I am perſwaded that the arguments againſt them are unanſwerable; for if I did not think ſo, then I ſhould be able to anſwer them, and if I were able to anſwer, I would not ſeek to
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:113292:176"/>perſwade others by that which does not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me; yet all indifferent perſons, that is, all thoſe who will ſuffer themſelves to be determined by ſomething beſides intereſt and education, muſt needs ſay they cannot be certain they are right, againſt whom there are ſo many arguments that they are in the wrong: The Commandement to worſhip God alone is ſo expreſſe; The diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>God</hi> and <hi>bread</hi> dedicated to the ſervice of God is ſo vaſt, the danger of worſhipping that which is not God, or of not worſhipping that which is God, is ſo formidable, that it is infinitely to be preſumed, that if it had been intended that we ſhould have worſhipped the holy Sacrament, the holy Scripture would have called it, <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or have bidden us in expreſſe termes to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored it; that either by the firſt, as by a <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon indicative,</hi> or by the ſecond as by a <hi>reaſon imperative</hi> we might have have had ſufficient warrant <hi>direct</hi> or <hi>conſequent</hi> to have paid a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip. Now that there is no implicit warrant in the Sacramental words of [This is my body] I have given very many reaſons to evince, by proving the words to be <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> and <hi>figurative.</hi> Adde to this; that ſuppoſing Chriſt preſent in their ſenſes, yet as they have ordered the buſineſſe, they have made it ſuperſtitious and Idololatrical; for
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:113292:177"/>they declare that the divine worſhip does belong alſo to the ſymbols of bread and wine, as being <hi>one with Chriſt;</hi> they are the words of <hi>Bellarmine;</hi>

For by many defects ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and inſenſible, by many notorious and evident, the change may be hindred, and the ſymbols ſtill remain as very bread and wine as ever, and rob God of his honour.

               <p n="4">4. I will not cenſure concerning the men that do it, or conſider concerning the action, whether it be <hi>formal idolatry</hi> or no. God is their Judge and mine, and I beg he would be pleaſed to have mercy upon us all; but yet they that are intereſted, for their own particulars ought to fear and conſider theſe
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:113292:179"/>things. 1. That no man without his own fault, can miſtake a creature ſo far, as to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to be a God. 2. That when the heathens worſhipped the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> they did it upon their confidence that they were Gods, and would not have given to them divine honours if they had thought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. 3. That the diſtinction of <hi>material</hi> and <hi>formal idolatry</hi> though it have a place in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, becauſe the underſtanding can conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an act with his error, and yet ſeparate the parts of the conſideration; yet it hath no place in <hi>Divinity;</hi> becauſe in things of ſo great concernment it cannot but be ſuppoſed highly agreeable to the goodneſſe and juſtice of God, that every man be ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in his duty and convenient notices. 4. That no man in the world upon theſe grounds, except he that is malicious and ſpightful, can be an <hi>Idolater;</hi> for if he have an ignorance great enough to excuſe him, he can be no <hi>Idolater;</hi> if he have not, he is ſpightful and malicious; and then all the heathens are alſo excuſed as well as they. 5. That if good intent and ignorance in ſuch caſes can take off the crime, then the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors that killed the Apoſtles thinking they did God good ſervice, and <hi>Saul</hi> in blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming the religion and perſecuting the ſervants of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and the Jewes themſelves
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:113292:180"/>in crucifying the Lord of life, <hi>who did it igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly as did alſo their Rulers,</hi> have met with their excuſe upon the ſame account. And therefore it is not ſafe for the men of the <hi>Roman</hi> communion to take <hi>anodyne medicines</hi> and <hi>narcotics</hi> to make them inſenſible of the pain; for it will not cure their diſeaſe. Their doing it upon the ſtock of <hi>error</hi> and <hi>ignorance</hi> I hope will diſpoſe them to receive a pardon: But yet that alſo ſuppoſes them criminal; And though I would not for all the world be their accuſer, or the aggravator of the crime, yet I am not unwilling to be their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer, that themſelves may avoid the danger. For though <hi>Iacob</hi> was innocent in lying with <hi>Leah</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Rachel,</hi> becauſe he had no cauſe to ſuſpect the deception; yet if <hi>Penelope</hi> who had not ſeen <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> in 20 yeers ſhould ſee one come to her nothing like <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> but ſaying he were her husband, ſhe ſhould give but an ill account of her chaſtity if ſhe ſhould actually admit him to her bed, only ſaying, if you be <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> or upon ſuppoſition that you are <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> I admit you. For if ſhe certainly admits him, of whom ſhe is uncertain if he be her husband, ſhe certainly is an adultereſſe: Becauſe ſhe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reaſon to doubt, ought firſt to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of her queſtion. Since therefore beſides the inſuperable doubts of the main article it
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:113292:180"/>ſelf, in the practiſe and the particulars there are acknowledged ſo many wayes of decepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and confeſſed that the actual failings are frequent (as I ſhewed before out of Pope <hi>Adrian</hi>) it will be but a weak excuſe to ſay, I worſhip thee if thou be the Son of God, but I do not worſhip thee, if thou beeſt not conſecrated, and in the mean time, the divine worſhip is actually exhibited to what is ſet before us. At the beſt we may ſay to theſe men, as our bleſſed Saviour to the woman of <hi>Samaria, Ye worſhip ye know not what; but we know what we worſhip.</hi> For concerning the action of adoration, this I am to ſay, That it is a fit addreſſe in the day of ſolemnity with a <hi>Surſum corda</hi> with our hearts lift up to heaven, where Chriſt ſits (we are ſure) at the right hand of the Father, for <hi>Nemo dignè manducat niſi priùs adoraverit,</hi> ſaid S. <hi>Auſtin No man eats Chriſts body worthily, but he that firſt adores Chriſt.</hi> But to terminate the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip to the Sacrament, to that which we eat, is ſo <hi>unreaſonable</hi>

But they that give ſcandal to Jewes by their Images, and leaving out the ſecond Commandement from their Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſmes, give offence to the Turks by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the Sacrament, and to all reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men by ſtriving againſt two or three Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and the notices of all mankind. <hi>We worſhip the fleſh of Chriſt in the myſteries</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Ambroſe) as the Apoſtles did worſhip it in our Saviour.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Spir.

But we give no divine honour to the ſignes: We do not call the Sacrament our God. And let it be conſidered; whether if the Primitive Church had ever done or taught that the divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ought to be given to the Sacrament, it had not been certain that the heathen would have retorted moſt of the arguments upon their heads by which the Chriſtians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved their worſhipping of Images. The Chriſtians upbraided them with worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the works of their hands, to which
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:113292:181"/>themſelves gave what figure they pleaſed, and then by certain forms conſecrated them and made by invocation (as they ſuppoſed) a divinity to dwell there. They objected to them that they worſhipped that which could neither ſee, nor hear, nor ſmell, nor taſt, nor move, nor underſtand: that which could grow old and periſh, that could be broken and burned, that was ſubject to the injury of Rats, and Mice, of Wormes and creeping things, that can be taken by enemies, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away, that is kept under lock and key for fear of Theevs and ſacrilegious perſons. Now if the Church of thoſe ages had thought and practiſed as they have done at <hi>Rome</hi> in theſe laſt ages, might not they have ſaid, Why may not we as well as you? do not you worſhip that with divine honours, and call it your God which can be burnt, and broken, which your ſelves form into a round or a ſquare figure, which the Oven firſt hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, and then your Prieſts conſecrate and by invocation make to be your God, which can ſee no more, nor hear, nor ſmell, then the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and gold upon our Images? Do not you adore that which Rats and Mice eat, which can grow mouldy, and ſowre, which you keep under locks and bars, for fear your God be ſtolne? Did not <hi>Lewis the ninth</hi> pawn your God to the <hi>Soldan of Egypt,</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:113292:182"/>that to this day the Aegyptian eſcut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheons by way of triumph bear upon them a pix with a wafer in it: True it is, that if we are beaten from our cities, we carry our Gods with us; but did not the Jeſuits carry your <hi>Hoſt</hi> (which you call God) about their necks from <hi>Venice</hi> in the time of the <hi>Interdict?</hi> And now why do you reprove that in us which you do in your ſelves? What could have been anſwered to them if the doctrine and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of our time had furniſhed them with theſe or the like inſtances? In vain it would have been to have replied; Yea but ours is the true God, and yours are falſe gods.

Upon this account, ſince none of the witty and ſubtle adverſaries of Chriſtianity ever did, or could make this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence by way of recrimination, it is certain there was no occaſion given; and therefore thoſe trifling pretences made out of ſome ſayings of the Fathers pretending the practiſe of worſhipping the Sacrament, muſt needs be Sophiſtry, and illuſion, and can need no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular conſideration.
